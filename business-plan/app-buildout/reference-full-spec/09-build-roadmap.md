# 09: Build roadmap

Part of the [Wayfold build specification](../README.md). The README's shared decisions, tier codes, credit codes and table names are final; this file sequences the work.

This file has two halves. The first is the milestones: what each stage is for, how long it takes, and how you know it is done. The second is an ordered backlog of 114 tickets (WF-001 to WF-114), each small enough for one Claude Code session. A section at the end explains how to work through it with Claude Code.

Effort assumes one developer with Claude Code working 25 to 35 focused hours a week (part time; halve the calendar if full time). Paths follow the repository layout in [02-architecture.md](02-architecture.md) section 2 (`apps/api`, `apps/worker`, `apps/web`, `apps/ios`, `packages/shared`, `packages/tokens`, `infra/`, `docs/`); if a path here differs from that tree, 02 wins. Spec references use the file numbers in the README table.

## 1. Milestones

| Milestone | Duration | Calendar (part time) | Tickets |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 validate | 2 to 4 weeks | Before week 1 | WF-001 to WF-003 |
| Phase 0 foundations | 3 to 4 weeks | Weeks 1 to 4 | WF-004 to WF-024 |
| Phase 1 hosted web beta | 6 to 8 weeks | Weeks 5 to 12 | WF-025 to WF-073 |
| Phase 2 iOS TestFlight | 5 to 7 weeks | Weeks 13 to 19 | WF-074 to WF-090 (including Family, WF-077) and WF-114 (Group Trip Pass) |
| Phase 3 public launch | 3 to 4 weeks | Weeks 20 to 23 | WF-091 to WF-100 |
| Phase 4 growth | Ongoing | Week 24 on | WF-101 to WF-113 |

Do not start a phase until the previous exit criteria are met. The biggest schedule risk is Phase 1 (tenancy and entitlements), not the mobile work.

### M0: validate

- **Goal:** learn whether anyone wants this before rewriting anything. No app code changes beyond a landing page.
- **Duration:** 2 to 4 weeks.
- **Exit criteria:** landing page live with waitlist; 10 user interviews done against a "yes" signal written down before the first call; price and paywall copy tested (Trip Pass $9.99, Plus $5.99 a month or $39.99 a year); provider terms questions answered (SerpApi, Geoapify, Travelpayouts). If there is no clear signal, stop and keep the app personal.

### Phase 0: foundations

- **Goal:** make the codebase safe to open up and move AI off the owner's personal subscription. Nothing user-facing changes.
- **Duration:** 3 to 4 weeks.
- **Exit criteria:** agents run on the Claude Messages API with metering (`ai_usage`, `credit_ledger`, ceilings); Docker image builds; CI green on Linux; a merge to `main` deploys to staging in under 10 minutes; one agent run finishes within its $0.80 cap on staging; scheduled agents are off in hosted mode; kill switches work.

### Phase 1: hosted web beta

- **Goal:** a real product on the web that strangers can sign up for, payments off (upgrade screens show "coming with the app"), proving the core loop and unit economics.
- **Duration:** 6 to 8 weeks.
- **Exit criteria:** accounts, sharing, entitlements and ledger working; zero cross-tenant leaks in automated tests; AI cost per active user within the modeled ceilings; admin console has audit, users, kill switches and AI spend; restore-from-backup drill done once; spend alerts fire in a drill; mobile web usable on iPhone Safari; axe clean and the token contrast test green, including `--tp-edge` and `--tp-warning-ink`; the owner's data migrated; 50 to 200 beta users invited and 4-week retention measured and recorded.

### Phase 2: iOS TestFlight

- **Goal:** a native app that passes the "not a website" test, with purchases working in sandbox for every product sold at launch (`plus`, `family`, `trip_pass`, `group_trip_pass`, credit packs; `pro` stays behind `tier_pro`).
- **Duration:** 5 to 7 weeks.
- **Exit criteria:** Capacitor app bundled (no `server.url`), purchases, push, account deletion, offline trip viewing; crash-free sessions at least 99.5 percent over 100 or more sessions; every sandbox purchase scenario passes (purchase, cancel, upgrade Plus to Family, refund, restore on a second device, billing retry, Trip Pass and Group Trip Pass each bound to a trip); polls and manual cost splitting work on every tier and pass that includes them; a trip fully browsable in airplane mode on a real device; self-check against App Review Guidelines 4.2, 4.8, 5.1.1(v), 3.1.2 and 1.2.

### Phase 3: public launch

- **Goal:** approved, live, with support and monitoring ready.
- **Duration:** 3 to 4 weeks, including one or two review cycles of 1 to 4 days.
- **Exit criteria:** App Review passed; support inbox, macros and FAQ live; load test at 10 times expected launch traffic done; runbooks and status page in place; crash-free at least 99.5 percent, API error rate under 1 percent, and no P0 in the first 72 hours after release.

### Phase 4: growth

- **Goal:** widen revenue without widening risk, in this order as the data allows: Stripe group payments, concierge, Pro, Wayfold for Advisors, printed trip books, LiteAPI booking, Android and SEO pages. Family and the Group Trip Pass are already on sale from launch (Phase 2 tickets).
- **Duration:** ongoing, each item 1 to 6 weeks.
- **Exit criteria per item:** D30 retention at least 15 percent, free-to-paid conversion 3 to 5 percent, monthly subscriber churn under 8 percent, LTV to CAC above 3 (targets, not gates). Pro launches only when measured agent cost is $0.60 or less per run over 200 runs, or over 15 percent of Plus payers buy agent-run credits. The **kill rule** applies: at month 9 after launch, if under 1 percent of monthly users pay and affiliate income is under $0.20 per monthly user per year, stop investing and keep it as a personal tool. The admin overview tracks both numbers from launch.
- **Scope note:** launch scope follows the README: `free`, `plus`, `family`, `trip_pass`, `group_trip_pass` and credit packs are sold at launch, and `pro` stays behind the `tier_pro` flag until its gate. So the Family plan (WF-077), households (WF-038), polls and manual cost splitting (WF-045, gated by WF-051) and the Group Trip Pass with the room-block request (WF-114) are built before the TestFlight and listing tickets. Phase 4 keeps only Stripe group payments (WF-102, for `group_trip_pass` and `pro`), advisors, print, LiteAPI and Pro.

## 2. Critical path

The single longest chain of dependencies; a slip anywhere on it moves the launch date.

```
WF-004 scaffold -> WF-007 CI -> WF-008 Docker -> WF-011 migrations -> WF-012 identity schema
  -> WF-013 AI schema -> WF-015 metering -> WF-016 ledger -> WF-017 ceilings -> WF-018 queue
  -> WF-019 Claude client -> WF-020 agent loop -> WF-023 breakers            (Phase 0 gate)
  -> WF-028 JWT -> WF-029 data access -> WF-030 RLS -> WF-031 leak tests -> WF-051 entitlements
  -> WF-052 paywall logic -> WF-071 to 073 data migration and beta           (Phase 1 gate)
  -> WF-074 RevenueCat webhook -> WF-075 credit grants -> WF-080 Capacitor shell
  -> WF-082 Sign in with Apple -> WF-083 purchases -> WF-089 TestFlight
  -> WF-090 purchase matrix (also needs WF-077 Family and WF-114 Group Trip Pass, built in parallel after WF-075 and WF-076)
  -> WF-096 listing -> WF-097 review notes -> WF-100 submit and launch       (Phase 3 gate)
```

Launch-scope products (Family, Group Trip Pass, polls and cost splitting) hang off the critical path: WF-038 feeds WF-077, WF-045 and WF-051 feed WF-114, and all of them must finish before WF-090 so the purchase matrix and review screenshots cover every product sold at launch.

Long-lead items that are off the code path but on the calendar path: Apple Developer enrollment (days to weeks; start in Phase 0), Paid Applications Agreement and tax forms, a Mac or Xcode Cloud, Travelpayouts approval, Viator and Stay22 approvals, and App Review itself.

## 3. Parallelizable tracks

| Track | Tickets | Can start | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A Platform and data | WF-004 to 011, 012, 025 to 027 | Day 1 | Blocks everything else at first |
| B AI and metering | WF-013 to 024, 049 to 050 | After WF-011 | The Phase 0 gate |
| C Tenancy and auth | WF-028 to 033 | After WF-012 | Needs WF-014 flags only for rate-limit switches |
| D Product modules | WF-037 to 048 | After WF-029 | Modules are independent; run 2 or 3 sessions at once on separate branches |
| E Frontend platform | WF-034 to 036, 087, 088 | After WF-028 | Can use mocked API until C finishes |
| F Monetization | WF-051, 052, 074 to 078, 114 | After WF-016 | Web beta shows the waitlist paywall only; Family and Group Trip Pass are built here for launch |
| G Affiliate | WF-053 to 055, 099, 101 | After WF-029 | Start the Travelpayouts application in Phase 0 |
| H Admin console | WF-056 to 063, 079, 091 to 095 | After WF-014 and WF-027 | Overview and users can be built against seeded data |
| I Notifications and privacy | WF-064 to 067, 085 to 086 | After WF-028 | Deletion and export are App Review requirements |
| J Observability and ops | WF-068 to 071, 098 | After WF-009 | Restore drill before Phase 1 gate |
| K iOS (needs a Mac) | WF-080 to 084, 087 to 090 | After WF-034 and WF-035 | Only the Mac-bound steps wait on hardware |

Two to three Claude Code sessions can run in parallel when their tickets touch different modules. Never run two tickets in parallel that both add an Alembic migration; they would create two heads (WF-011 makes CI fail on multiple heads).

## 4. Risk register

## 5. Backlog

Conventions for every ticket:

- **Heading:** `WF-NNN title [phase, size, needs ...]`. Sizes: S (about 2 hours), M (half a day), L (a day; never larger, split instead).
- **Definition of done (DoD)**, applied to every ticket and written once here. Each ticket's Done line adds only what is extra.
  1. The change is on a branch, reviewed against the ticket's acceptance list, and merged to `main` through a pull request; one commit per ticket, message `WF-NNN title`.
  2. `npm run lint` and `npm test` pass locally and in CI. The tests named in the ticket exist and fail without the change.
  3. If any route or schema changed: `npm run gen:api` was run and the regenerated `apps/web/src/lib/api/schema.d.ts` is committed.
  4. If any model or migration changed: the migration follows `.claude/rules/database-migrations.md` (expand and contract, one head, tested from empty and from the previous revision).
  5. New environment variables are documented in `.env.example`; no secrets in the repo.
  6. UI copy follows the copy rules (sentence case, plain verbs, no em dashes) and the passport design tokens.
  7. The work respects the non-negotiable rules in the README (no ranking by commission, no fetching Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking.com pages, sources on every AI fact).

### E0 M0 validate

#### WF-001 Name, domain and email [M0, S, needs none]
- Description: pick the working name Wayfold, check the trademark and App Store name, buy `wayfold.app`, set up `support@`, `no-reply@` and the Resend sending domain with SPF, DKIM and DMARC. Spec: [02-architecture.md](02-architecture.md).
- Accept: domain resolves through Cloudflare; a test email from `no-reply@wayfold.app` passes SPF, DKIM and DMARC; name availability notes saved in `docs/adr/0001-name.md`.
- Touches: `docs/adr/`, `infra/cloudflare/dns.md` (record list).
- Tests: a script `infra/scripts/check-mail-auth` that queries the DNS records and exits non-zero if any is missing.
- Done: DoD plus the decision recorded and the script run against the live domain.

#### WF-002 Landing page and waitlist [M0, M, needs WF-001]
- Description: a static page on Cloudflare Pages with the positioning line "Plan together. Know the fare.", the logo, a waitlist form (email plus "who do you plan trips with"), and a privacy note. Waitlist entries land in a table or Resend audience.
- Accept: form submit stores one entry per email (duplicates ignored); confirmation email sent; page scores 90 or more on Lighthouse mobile; no ad or tracking SDKs; privacy text links to a policy page.
- Touches: `apps/web/landing/` (static page deployed to Cloudflare Pages), a small `POST /v1/waitlist` route in `apps/api/wayfold/modules/notifications/`.
- Tests: route accepts valid email, rejects invalid, dedupes, rate limits; Playwright submit flow.
- Done: DoD plus page live on the production domain.

#### WF-003 Interview kit, price test and terms checklist [M0, S, needs WF-002]
- Description: write the interview script, the written "yes" signal, the paywall and price test cards (Trip Pass $9.99; Plus $5.99 a month or $39.99 a year), and the provider terms checklist (SerpApi terms and the Google lawsuit, Geoapify caching terms, Travelpayouts rates and app eligibility).
- Accept: 10 interviews logged with outcome; each terms question has an answer or an owner and a date; a go or no-go decision record exists.
- Touches: `docs/validation/`.
- Tests: none (documentation); checklist reviewed by the owner.
- Done: DoD plus a signed decision record. A "no-go" stops the backlog here.

### E1 Repository, CI, Docker and environments

#### WF-004 Scaffold the repository [P0, M, needs WF-003]
- Description: create the Wayfold monorepo with the tree in [02-architecture.md](02-architecture.md) section 2: `apps/api` (Python 3.13, uv, FastAPI), `apps/worker`, `apps/web` (Vite, React 19, TanStack Query, Tailwind 4), `packages/shared`, `packages/tokens`, `packages/eslint-config`, `infra/`, `.github/` (workflows and Dependabot), `docs/` (`apps/ios` arrives in WF-080), a uv workspace and npm workspaces, root `package.json` scripts (`setup`, `start`, `dev`, `test`, `lint`, `format`, `gen:api`), `.env.example`, a project `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/` stubs (database migrations, agent routines, frontend).
- Accept: `npm run setup && npm test && npm run lint` pass on a clean clone on Linux and Windows; `GET /health/live` returns 200.
- Touches: repo root (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`), `apps/api/pyproject.toml`, `apps/web/package.json`, `packages/`, `infra/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`.
- Tests: one pytest for the health route, one vitest smoke render.
- Done: DoD plus the README explains setup in under 10 lines.

#### WF-005 Port reusable modules [P0, L, needs WF-004]
- Description: copy and adapt from the Trip Planner repo the modules that carry over: flight route and fare logic, itinerary and lodging logic, presentation mode, passport design tokens (into `packages/tokens`, plus the two added in [05-ui-ux-spec.md](05-ui-ux-spec.md) section 2: `--tp-edge` and `--tp-warning-ink`), Travelpayouts, Geoapify, Wikipedia and Frankfurter providers, evidence rules in `services/agent_ingest.py`, and agent prompts. Leave behind passcode auth, the Claude CLI runner, the MCP bridge, APScheduler, Windows scripts and Tailscale sharing. Follow the module map in [02-architecture.md](02-architecture.md).
- Accept: ported modules import cleanly and keep their original unit tests passing; a `docs/porting-map.md` lists each source file and its new home; no Windows-only code in `apps/` or `packages/`.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/providers/`, `apps/api/wayfold/modules/*/service.py` (ported logic), `packages/tokens/`, `apps/web/src/lib/`.
- Tests: the original tests for each ported module, adapted; a test that greps for forbidden imports (`subprocess` Claude CLI, `apscheduler`).
- Done: DoD plus the porting map reviewed.

#### WF-006 Typed configuration and environments [P0, M, needs WF-004]
- Description: a settings module (`config.py`, the only place environment variables are read) with `ENVIRONMENT` (`local`, `ci`, `preview`, `staging`, `production`) as in 02 section 7. The app refuses to start without the required secrets for its environment, keeps scheduled agents off until the `scheduled_agent_routines` flag is on, and tests refuse to run when `ENVIRONMENT=production`. There is no personal or single-household mode: the Windows-only and passcode paths of the old Trip Planner are not carried over (02 section 1.1).
- Accept: settings load from env with typed validation; missing required secrets fail fast with a clear message listing names only; `.env.example` lists every variable.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/config.py`, `.env.example`, `apps/api/tests/test_config.py`.
- Tests: settings matrix (each environment), refusal when production, required-secret errors.
- Done: DoD plus `.env.example` checked against `config.py` in CI.

#### WF-007 CI pipeline [P0, M, needs WF-004]
- Description: GitHub Actions `ci.yml` in `.github/workflows/` (the only place GitHub runs workflows from; the 02 repository tree puts them there): lint, tests with a `postgres:18` service, OpenAPI drift check, migration test from empty and from the previous release, image build; `e2e.yml` for the Playwright smoke test.
- Accept: a PR with a failing test, lint error, API drift or two Alembic heads turns CI red; a clean PR is green in under 10 minutes.
- Touches: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`.
- Tests: a deliberately broken branch for each check (recorded in the PR).
- Done: DoD plus branch protection requires CI on `main`.

#### WF-008 Docker image, compose and health endpoints [P0, M, needs WF-007]
- Description: multi-stage Dockerfile (`node:22` builds the web, `python:3.13-slim` with `uv sync --frozen --no-dev`, non-root), commands `api`, `worker`, `scheduler`, `migrate`; `infra/docker/compose.yml` (Postgres 18, Mailpit, MinIO); `/health/live` and `/health/ready` (database reachable, migrations at head).
- Accept: `docker compose up` serves the API; image runs as non-root; ready fails when migrations are behind; image scanned with Trivy in CI.
- Touches: `infra/docker/Dockerfile`, `infra/docker/compose.yml`, `apps/api/wayfold/main.py` (health routes).
- Tests: readiness test with a stale migration; container smoke test in CI.
- Done: DoD plus image size noted in the PR.

#### WF-009 Render and Cloudflare environments and deploy workflows [P0, L, needs WF-008]
- Description: `infra/render/render.yaml` for API, worker and Postgres 18 (PITR) for staging and production; pre-deploy migration command with an advisory lock; Cloudflare DNS, TLS and WAF, Pages for the web build; `deploy-staging.yml` (on merge) and `deploy-prod.yml` (manual approval, promote the same image digest, rollback on failed health check). Spec: [02-architecture.md](02-architecture.md).
- Accept: a merge to `main` reaches staging with migrations applied in under 10 minutes; production deploy needs approval; secrets live only in platform env groups.
- Touches: `infra/render/render.yaml`, `.github/workflows/deploy-*.yml`, `infra/cloudflare/`.
- Tests: post-deploy smoke test script; a forced failing health check triggers rollback (recorded).
- Done: DoD plus separate Anthropic workspace keys for staging and production.

#### WF-010 Security scanning workflows [P0, S, needs WF-007]
- Description: `security.yml` (pip-audit, npm audit, gitleaks, CodeQL, Trivy), Dependabot grouped weekly, GitHub secret scanning and push protection.
- Accept: a planted fake secret is caught by gitleaks in a test branch; workflows run weekly and on PR.
- Touches: `.github/workflows/security.yml`, `.github/dependabot.yml`.
- Tests: the planted-secret branch (not merged).
- Done: DoD plus findings triaged.

### E2 Database and migrations

#### WF-011 Migration framework and database roles [P0, M, needs WF-008]
- Description: Alembic on Postgres 18 with `lock_timeout` and `statement_timeout`, an advisory lock around `upgrade head`, a check for multiple heads, UUIDv7 helper, and the roles from [03-database-schema.md](03-database-schema.md) section 6.1: `wayfold_owner` (owns objects, runs migrations), `wayfold_app` (the API, subject to RLS), `wayfold_worker` (jobs, bypasses RLS) and `wayfold_admin` for the admin API (see [08-admin-control-center.md](08-admin-control-center.md)). Write the expand and contract policy into `.claude/rules/database-migrations.md`.
- Accept: migrations run from empty and from the previous revision; two heads fail CI; `wayfold_app` cannot run DDL; the rules file documents the policy.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/migrations/`, `apps/api/wayfold/db.py`, `.claude/rules/database-migrations.md`.
- Tests: migration-from-empty test, head-count test, role privilege tests.
- Done: DoD plus the rules file updated.

#### WF-012 Identity and trips schema [P0, M, needs WF-011]
- Description: migration for `users`, `auth_identities`, `devices`, `households`, `household_members`, `trips`, `trip_members`, `trip_invites`, `trip_share_links`, `trip_destinations`, `people` (with `owner_user_id`, `linked_user_id`), `trip_people`, `activity_log`, `support_tickets`, `idempotency_keys` (the 24 hour replay store for `Idempotency-Key`). `trips` carries `version`, `editors_can_invite` and `calendar_token_hash`; `users` carries the `suspended` status and the column-level update grant of 03 section 6.1. UUIDv7 public ids, `timestamptz`, money as integer minor units. DDL in [03-database-schema.md](03-database-schema.md).
- Accept: migration applies cleanly; constraints and indexes match 03; models and Pydantic schemas exist.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/migrations/versions/`, `apps/api/wayfold/modules/{auth,trips,collaboration,billing}/models.py`.
- Tests: constraint tests (unique member per trip, valid roles), schema-vs-DDL comparison test.
- Done: DoD plus seed data for two test users and a shared trip.

#### WF-013 AI, credit and run schema [P0, M, needs WF-012]
- Description: migration for `routines` (with `next_run_at`), `runs`, `run_events`, `ai_usage`, `credit_ledger`, `credit_grants`, `credit_debts`, `credit_action_prices`, `provider_calls`, `provider_call_rollups`, `shared_research_cache`; the unique partial index `uq_runs_one_active_agent` behind the one-agent-run-per-account admission check; `idempotency_key` uniques; the credit functions of 03 section 5.13 (`reserve_credits`, `settle_credits`, `record_credit_debt`, `settle_credit_debt`, `ensure_free_monthly_grant`, `ensure_taster_grant`).
- Accept: migration applies; a second concurrent agent run for one account is refused at admission by `uq_runs_one_active_agent` (409 `run_already_active`); ledger idempotency key unique; `reserve_credits` refuses an account with a credit debt.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/migrations/versions/`, `apps/api/wayfold/modules/ai/models.py`, `modules/credits/models.py`.
- Tests: concurrency test for the one-run-per-account admission check; duplicate idempotency key rejected.
- Done: DoD plus costs stored as micro-dollars.

#### WF-014 Feature flags and kill switches [P0, M, needs WF-012]
- Description: migration for `feature_flags` (`key`, `kind`, `enabled`, `rollout_pct`, `rules`, `variants`) and `kill_switches` (`key`, `engaged`, `reason`, `engaged_by`, `engaged_at`, `expires_at`, `expiry_notified_at`, `auto_rule`; admin-set switches must carry an expiry, `user:<id>` keys are per-account holds); a runtime that evaluates flags (cached 5 seconds per process, invalidated by `NOTIFY`) and **fails closed** for paid calls if the tables cannot be read. Seed keys are in [03-database-schema.md](03-database-schema.md) section 11.5; the console that edits them is in [08-admin-control-center.md](08-admin-control-center.md).
- Accept: flipping `ai.all` blocks AI calls within 5 seconds; engaging or clearing a switch writes `audit_log`; unreadable table blocks paid calls.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/modules/admin/flags.py`, `apps/api/wayfold/migrations/versions/`, `packages/shared/src/flags.ts`.
- Tests: evaluation rules (percent, tier, platform), fail-closed test, audit test.
- Done: DoD plus a practice drill written in `docs/runbooks/kill-switches.md`.

### E3 AI metering and agents (Phase 0 gate)

#### WF-015 AI metering and price table [P0, M, needs WF-013]
- Description: a versioned price constant in `ai/pricing.py` (06 section 6.1; not a database table) holding the model prices (Claude Haiku 4.5 `claude-haiku-4-5`, Claude Sonnet 5.5 `claude-sonnet-5-5`, web search per use) and a metering wrapper that converts `response.usage` (input, output, cache read and write, web searches) into micro-dollars and writes an `ai_usage` row in the same transaction as the run event. Spec: [06-ai-agents-spec.md](06-ai-agents-spec.md).
- Accept: cost matches a hand calculation for 5 sample responses; Batch calls are halved on tokens; `provider_calls` records SerpApi and Geoapify spend with account and trip.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/modules/ai/metering.py`, `modules/ai/pricing.py`.
- Tests: table-driven cost tests, rollback test (no usage row if the event insert fails).
- Done: DoD plus price table never edited in place.

#### WF-016 Credit ledger service [P0, L, needs WF-013]

FOR UPDATE` on the balance; lazy monthly grants (Free 12, Plus 60, Family 150, Pro 240); purchased credits expire after 12 months. Action prices: `explain` 1, `live_search` 1, `draft_day` 1, `draft_trip` 4, `research` 8 (1 from cache), `agent_run` 40 (8 from cache).
- Accept: parallel reservations never overspend; a failed or empty action is refunded; a stopped agent run is billed pro rata with an 8 credit minimum; negative balance after a refund blocks new actions.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/modules/credits/`, `packages/shared/src/credits.ts`.
- Tests: concurrency test with 20 parallel reservations; every ledger `kind`; expiry; spend order.

Generalizes the old single SerpApi cap.
- Accept: a ceiling stops paid work but never cached reads; a run is admitted with $0.80 monthly headroom even if the day is exhausted, and then blocks other paid actions that day; ledger unreadable means refuse.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/modules/credits/budget.py`.
- Tests: boundary tests per tier, admission rule, fail-closed test.
- Done: DoD plus ceilings read from settings (changeable by [08](08-admin-control-center.md)).

- Accept: two schedulers never double-fire; an outage fires one check, not twelve; no agent job is ever scheduled while the flag is off; live routes are checked daily within 120 days of departure within tier limits.
- Touches: `apps/worker/wayfold_worker/scheduler.py`, `apps/worker/wayfold_worker/jobs/scan_due_routines.py`.
- Tests: two-leader test, jitter stability test, misfire test, flag test.
- Done: DoD plus scheduler heartbeat exposed.

Rows that two people edit carry `version` (03 convention 11).
- Accept: migration applies; every trip-scoped table has `trip_id` for RLS; indexes on common lookups.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/migrations/versions/`, `apps/api/wayfold/modules/{flights,itinerary,places,lodging,trips,collaboration,groups}/models.py`.
- Tests: schema-vs-DDL test; foreign key and cascade tests.
- Done: DoD.

#### WF-026 Billing and revenue schema [P1, M, needs WF-012]

- Tests: uniqueness and idempotency constraint tests.
- Done: DoD.

#### WF-027 Operations schema and seed data [P1, M, needs WF-012]
- Description: migration for `admin_users`, `audit_log` (append only, update and delete rejected by trigger; `retention_class` of 03 section 8), `content_reports`, `support_tickets`, `consents`, `data_exports`, `deletion_requests`, `rate_limit_counters`, `airports`, `fx_rates`; seed airports and the default plans, store products, credit prices, flags and kill switches (03 section 11). Product analytics stay in PostHog, so there is no `analytics_events` table.
- Accept: `audit_log` rejects `UPDATE` and `DELETE`; seeds are idempotent.
- Touches: `apps/api/wayfold/migrations/versions/`, `apps/api/wayfold/modules/{admin,auth,flights}/models.py`, `apps/api/wayfold/seed/`.

## 6. How to work with Claude Code

- **One ticket, one session.** Start a fresh session per ticket. Tell Claude: "Do WF-0NN from `09-build-roadmap.md`. Read the ticket, its dependencies, and the spec files it names first." A ticket that cannot be finished in one session is too big: split it and add the new ticket under the same epic.
- **Keep the session small.** Aim for about 400 changed lines and at most one migration. If context grows long, finish, commit and start a new session rather than continuing.
- **Plan before code.** For L tickets, ask for a short plan (files, tests, risks) and approve it, then build.
- **Tests first.** Write or ask for the failing tests named in the ticket before the implementation. The acceptance criteria are the test list.
- **Always run the checks.** Before declaring done, run `npm run lint` and `npm test` (and `npm run gen:api` when routes changed, the e2e smoke test when a flow changed). Paste the result in the PR. Do not accept "tests should pass".
- **Use Sonnet for subagents.** Any subagent spawned while building this project must use the Sonnet model (`claude-sonnet-5-5`). Use subagents for read-heavy work (searching the spec, reviewing a diff), not for writing migrations.
- **Commit per ticket.** One commit or one small PR per ticket with the message `WF-0NN title`; never mix tickets. Tickets that add migrations merge one at a time.
- **Read the rules first.** Read `.claude/rules/database-migrations.md` before any model or migration change, the agent rules before touching the worker or agent code, and the frontend rules before UI copy or styling.
- **Do not grow the project instructions unprompted.** If something seems worth keeping, say so in one line and let the owner decide. Reference and procedures go in `docs/` or `.claude/skills/`; a procedure that repeats becomes a skill.
- **Safety rules apply in every session.** No secrets in the repo; no fetching of Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking.com pages; no scraper libraries; no ranking by commission; no em dashes in copy.
- **Parallelism.** Run 2 or 3 sessions in parallel only when tickets touch different modules and at most one adds a migration. Use separate branches and merge the migration ticket first.
- **Mac-bound work.** iOS tickets (WF-080 to WF-090) need macOS; do the web and backend parts first and batch the device steps.
- **When stuck.** If acceptance criteria conflict with a spec, stop and ask; the README's shared decisions win, then the topic spec, then this file.
- **Gate reviews.** At each phase exit, run the exit checklist in section 1 as a session of its own and write the result to `docs/gates/phase-N.md` before starting the next phase.
