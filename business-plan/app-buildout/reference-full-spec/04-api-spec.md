# 04. API specification

Part of the [Wayfold build specification](../README.md). The README decisions (tiers, credit action codes, table names, non-negotiable rules) are final and this file follows them. Table, column, enum and limit-key names come from [03-database-schema.md](03-database-schema.md) (the database), the agents behind the AI endpoints in [06-ai-agents-spec.md](06-ai-agents-spec.md), purchases and paywall logic in [07-monetization-spec.md](07-monetization-spec.md), and the admin console in [08-admin-control-center.md](08-admin-control-center.md).

Written 2026-09-30. This file defines every HTTP endpoint the web and iOS clients and the partner systems call. It is written so the route modules can be built one per section, in FastAPI, and the TypeScript client generated from the result.

## 1. Conventions

### 1.1 Base URL, format and versioning

| Item | Rule |
|---|---|
| API base | `https://api.wayfold.app/v1` in production, `https://api.staging.wayfold.app/v1` in staging, `http://localhost:8000/v1` in development. All paths below are relative to it unless they start with `/go`, `/health` or `/.well-known` (those are served at the host root). |
| Redirect host | `https://go.wayfold.app/go/{click_id}` (same service, separate hostname so cookies and CSP never mix with the API). |
| Format | JSON (`application/json; charset=utf-8`) in and out. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`, times `HH:MM:SS`, timestamps RFC 3339 in UTC (`2026-09-30T14:05:00Z`). Only the SSE and redirect endpoints return something else. |
| Names | `snake_case` for fields, `kebab-case` for path segments, plural nouns for collections. |
| Ids | Every public id is a UUIDv7 string. Integer ids from the existing Trip Planner never appear. Ids are opaque: clients never parse them. |
| Money | `{ "amount_minor": 13900, "currency": "USD" }`: integer minor units plus ISO 4217. Fares and lodging prices also carry `observed_at`. Never a float. |
| Nulls | Absent optional fields are returned as `null`, never omitted, so generated types are stable. In PATCH bodies, an omitted field means "leave unchanged" and an explicit `null` clears a nullable field. |
| Versioning | The major version is in the path. Additive changes (new fields, endpoints, enum values) are not breaking: clients must ignore unknown fields and treat unknown enum values as "other". A breaking change ships as `/v2` alongside `/v1` for at least 12 months. Old iOS builds are supported through `X-Client-Version` (1.7) and a minimum-version gate on `GET /me`. |
| Compression and caching | gzip and brotli. Reads that return `ETag` support `If-None-Match` and answer `304`. Responses carry `Cache-Control: private, no-store` unless an endpoint says otherwise. |

### 1.2 Authentication

- Sign-in happens in Supabase Auth (Sign in with Apple, Google, email code). The client sends the Supabase access token on every call: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`. The web build may instead send the HttpOnly session cookie; cookie requests must also send `X-Wayfold-Client: web` and a same-origin `Origin` (CSRF guard carried over from `X-Trip-Planner: 1`).
- One FastAPI dependency, `CurrentUser`, verifies signature (JWKS, cached 1 hour and refreshed at most once a minute on an unknown `kid`, 02 section 6), `iss`, `aud`, `exp` and `sub`, resolves `auth_identities(provider, subject)` to a `users` row, and rejects any status other than `active` with `403 account_inactive` (status `pending_deletion` gets `403 account_pending_deletion`, and only `POST /me/deletion/cancel` and `GET /me` work). A first-time valid JWT with no identity row is handled by `POST /me/bootstrap`, the only endpoint that accepts a JWT without a users row.
- Agent workers do not use user tokens. The worker calls internal functions directly, not HTTP. The legacy `/api/agent/v1` bridge is removed.
- Partner callers (webhooks) authenticate with signatures or shared secrets (section 6). Admin callers use the admin API (section 5.25).
- Guest mode is local-first; a guest has no token and calls no endpoint until they tap "Save your trip". `POST /me/claim` merges guest data after sign-in (5.1).

### 1.3 Authorization: roles and 404 for non-members

| Role | Code | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | `owner` | Everything on the trip, including delete, transfer, invites and share links. Exactly one per trip. |
| Editor | `editor` | Edit itinerary, lodging, flights, notes, checklist; vote; start AI actions from their own credits; invite viewers if the owner allows. |
| Viewer | `viewer` | Read, comment, vote in polls and lodging votes. No edits, no AI, no invites. |

Trip-scoped routes declare a minimum role through `require_trip(trip_id, min_role)`. A caller who is not a member gets `404 not_found`, never `403`, for every id in the path, so ids cannot be probed. A member whose role is too low gets `403 insufficient_role`. Routes that take a child id (for example `/lodging/{id}`) join up to the trip and apply the same rule. A CI test walks `app.routes` and fails if any route with an id parameter does not use the dependency. Request bodies never accept `owner`, `role` (except on invite and member-role routes), `tier` or `user_id`.

Trip capabilities (what the trip can do) come from the better of the owner's tier and any active `trip_passes` row for that trip. Credits are charged to the acting user. Both are explained to the client through `capabilities` (2.3) and `GET /me/entitlements` (5.19).

### 1.4 Errors: RFC 9457 problem+json

Every non-2xx response has `Content-Type: application/problem+json` and this shape:

```ts
type Problem = {
  type: string              // "https://api.wayfold.app/problems/<code>"
  title: string             // short, stable English summary
  status: number
  code: string              // machine code from the catalogue (section 3)
  detail: string            // human sentence, safe to show; no em dashes
  instance: string          // "/v1/trips/0191..."
  request_id: string        // same as X-Request-Id
  errors?: { field: string; code: string; message: string }[]   // validation only
  retry_after_seconds?: number
  current?: unknown         // 409 version_conflict: the latest resource
  paywall?: PaywallHint     // 402 and 403 gate errors: see 5.20
  credits?: { needed: number; balance: number }                  // insufficient_credits
}
```

Clients switch on `code`, never on `title` or `detail`. Stack traces and SQL never appear. FastAPI's default 422 body is replaced by a handler that maps to `validation_failed` with `errors`.

### 1.5 Pagination

Collections that can grow use cursor pagination. Small bounded collections (a trip's days, a trip's members) return a plain array.

```
GET /v1/trips?limit=50&cursor=eyJ0IjoiMDE5MS4uLiJ9
-> 200 { "items": [ ... ], "next_cursor": "eyJ0Ijoi..." | null, "has_more": true }
```

`limit` defaults to 50, maximum 200. Cursors are opaque, signed, expire after 24 hours, and encode the sort key plus id. Default order is newest first by `created_at` unless an endpoint says otherwise. Sync-style lists also accept `updated_since=<timestamp>` and return deleted rows as tombstones (`{ "id": "...", "deleted_at": "..." }`) so polling clients can drop them.

### 1.6 Idempotency keys

`Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` (client generated) is **required** on every POST that spends credits or money, and optional but honored on all other POSTs. The required list: `/trips/{id}/ai/*`, `/trips/{id}/agent-runs`, `/trips/{id}/flights/live-search`, `/trips/{id}/lodging/rental-search`, `/trips/{id}/concierge-requests`, `/trips/{id}/room-block-requests`, `/credits/packs/claim`, `/purchases/sync`, `/trips/{id}/expenses`, `/trips/{id}/settlements`, `/print-orders`, `/trips/{id}/agent-runs/{id}/cancel` (no cost, but it refunds).

- Keys are stored for 24 hours with the request hash, the status and the response body (`idempotency_keys` holds one row per user and key with the method, path, request hash, state, status and response; credit spends also carry the key, prefixed with the user id, in `ai_usage.idempotency_key` and `credit_ledger.idempotency_key`, so a retry can never charge twice even if the row is gone). The same key with the same body replays the original response and adds `Idempotent-Replay: true`. The same key with a different body gets `422 idempotency_key_reused`. The same key while the first request is still running gets `409 idempotency_in_progress` with `Retry-After: 1`.
- A missing key on a required route gets `400 idempotency_key_required`.
- Credit reservation and ledger writes key off the same value, so a retried agent start can never charge twice.

### 1.7 Optimistic concurrency

Every editable resource has an integer `version` starting at 1, incremented on each successful write by the `bump_version()` trigger (03 convention 11: trips, itinerary days and items, routes, lodging options, polls, expenses, checklist items, notes and routines), and returns a strong `ETag: "<version>"`. Two equivalent ways to send it:

- `If-Match: "<version>"` header on `PATCH`, `PUT` and `DELETE` (preferred).
- `version` in the body of a PATCH.

If both are absent, the write is rejected with `428 precondition_required` for resources marked "versioned" below (trip, days, items, routes, lodging options, notes, polls, expenses, checklist items, routines). On mismatch the response is `409 version_conflict` with the latest resource in `current`, and the client shows its conflict sheet ("Sam changed this. Keep yours or use theirs."). Last-writer-wins applies only to the offline queue, per field, where the client re-sends with the new version. Lists return `ETag` over the collection state and support `If-None-Match` for cheap polling (every 15 to 30 seconds on a shared trip, plus on foreground).

### 1.8 Rate limits and headers

Limits are stored in Postgres (`rate_limit_counters`, rows expire after a day) until about 10k MAU. Every response carries the IETF draft headers:

```
RateLimit-Limit: 120
RateLimit-Remaining: 117
RateLimit-Reset: 38          # seconds until the window resets
RateLimit-Policy: 120;w=60
```

A rejected call returns `429 rate_limited` with `Retry-After` (seconds). Starting limits:

| Surface | Limit |
|---|---|
| Write API (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) | 120 per minute per user, 600 per minute per IP |
| Read API | 600 per minute per user |
| Email code and sign-in exchange | handled at Supabase (5 per email per hour, 20 per IP per hour); `POST /me/bootstrap` 30 per IP per 10 minutes |
| Invites | 30 created per user per day, 20 pending per trip |
| AI actions | 30 per hour per user, one agent run at a time per account, plus credits and provider-spend ceilings |
| `POST /outbound` | 60 per hour per user, repeats within 30 seconds deduplicated |
| Share link views | 60 per minute per IP and 600 per hour per token |
| Export and deletion request | 1 per day each |
| Webhooks | not rate limited; signature failures 20 per minute per IP then blocked at Cloudflare |

### 1.9 Other headers and behaviors

| Header | Direction | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `X-Request-Id` | both | Client may send one (uuid); server always returns one and logs it with every line. |
| `X-Client-Version` | request | `ios/1.2.0` or `web/2026.10.3`. The server answers `426 client_upgrade_required` only when below `min_client_version` from `GET /me`. |
| `Accept-Language` | request | Locale for error `detail` and AI output. |
| `X-Wayfold-Client` | request | `web`, `ios`. Required with cookie auth. |
| `Idempotency-Key`, `If-Match`, `If-None-Match` | request | See 1.6 and 1.7. |
| `Deprecation`, `Sunset` | response | Set on endpoints being retired. |
| `Server-Timing` | response | `db;dur=12, ai;dur=840` for debugging. |

Kill switches (table `kill_switches`) can disable a feature at runtime. A disabled feature returns `503 feature_disabled` with `retry_after_seconds` when known. Cached data endpoints keep working when AI or live providers are switched off.

### 1.10 Async work

Anything longer than about 2 seconds (agent runs, exports, deletions, print orders, live searches that fan out to providers) returns `202 Accepted` with a resource to poll and, for agent runs, an SSE stream. A `Location` header points to the status resource. Jobs are Procrastinate tasks; workers never call the API over HTTP.

### 1.11 CORS and security headers

Allowed origins: the web app, `capacitor://localhost`, `https://localhost`. Allowed headers include `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `Idempotency-Key`, `If-Match`, `If-None-Match`, `X-Wayfold-Client`, `X-Client-Version`, `X-Request-Id`. Exposed headers: `ETag`, `RateLimit-*`, `Retry-After`, `Idempotent-Replay`, `X-Request-Id`, `Location`. HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on all responses.

### 1.12 Tenant isolation and logging

Every request runs in a transaction with `SET LOCAL app.user_id` so row-level security catches a forgotten check. Each request logs one structured line: request id, user id, route template, status, latency, credits charged. No request bodies are logged. Notes, private comments and pasted text never go to Sentry.

## 2. Shared types

Used by the endpoint tables. Written as TypeScript-like blocks; FastAPI models mirror them.

### 2.1 Primitives

```ts
type Uuid = string                          // UUIDv7
type Money = { amount_minor: number; currency: string }
type Iata = string                          // "LIS"
type Role = "owner" | "editor" | "viewer"
type Tier = "free" | "plus" | "family" | "pro"
type Product = Tier | "trip_pass" | "group_trip_pass"
type CreditAction = "explain" | "live_search" | "draft_day" | "draft_trip" | "research" | "agent_run"
type Page<T> = { items: T[]; next_cursor: string | null; has_more: boolean }
type Attribution = { id: Uuid; display_name: string | null }   // null display_name means "Former member"
```

### 2.2 Credit and gate envelopes

Every credit-spending success body includes:

```ts
type CreditReceipt = {
  action: CreditAction
  reserved: number            // credits held at start
  charged: number | null      // null until settled; 1 when served from shared cache
  from_cache: boolean
  balance_after: number       // total spendable credits now
  reservation_id: Uuid        // credit_ledger.reservation_id; one action's reserve, refund and settle rows share it
}
```

```ts
type PaywallHint = {
  reason: "trip_limit" | "sharing" | "live_routes" | "credits" | "agent_taster_used"
        | "routines" | "family_members" | "traveler_limit" | "group_tools" | "group_payments"
  offer_url: string           // GET /v1/paywall/offer?reason=...&trip_id=...
  free_path: string           // what the user can still do for free, plain sentence
}
```

### 2.3 Trip and capabilities

```ts
type Capabilities = {
  effective_tier: Tier | "trip_pass" | "group_trip_pass"
  source: "owner_tier" | "trip_pass" | "advisor_seat"
  can_invite: boolean               // owner has Plus or better, or an active pass
  max_collaborators: number         // plans.limits.collaborators: Free 0, Plus 6, Family 6, Pro 12, Trip Pass 6, Group Trip Pass 11
  live_routes_max: number           // Free 0 (cached only), Plus 3, Family 5, Pro 6, Trip Pass 2, Group Trip Pass 2
  live_routes_used: number
  live_checks_left: number | null   // either pass: live_checks_max (60) minus live_checks_used
  can_use_group_tools: boolean      // polls and manual cost splitting: owner on Plus, Family or Pro, or a Trip Pass or Group Trip Pass on the trip
  can_collect_payments: boolean     // Phase 4, Stripe: plans.limits.group_payments (Group Trip Pass on the trip or owner on Pro) and the group_payments flag on
  can_request_room_block: boolean   // Group Trip Pass only (plans.limits.room_block_request)
  agent_enabled: boolean            // owner setting and consent
  limited: boolean                  // tier lapsed: members downgraded to viewers, banner shown
  pass_expires_at: string | null
}

type Trip = {
  id: Uuid; version: number
  name: string; status: "planning" | "booked" | "done" | "archived"
  start_date: string | null; end_date: string | null
  home_currency: string; notes: string
  destinations: Destination[]
  travelers: Person[]                          // people linked through trip_people
  cover: { image_url: string; destination_name: string; attribution: string | null } | null
  flight_dates: { start: string; end: string | null; flights: ChosenFlightRef[] } | null
  my_role: Role
  capabilities: Capabilities
  ai_enabled: boolean                          // owner toggle
  editors_can_invite: boolean                  // owner setting (trips.editors_can_invite): editors may invite viewers
  member_count: number
  owner: Attribution
  created_at: string; updated_at: string; deleted_at: string | null
}
```

`Trip` keeps the shape of today's `TripOut` (destinations, travelers, cover, flight dates) and adds `version`, `my_role`, `capabilities`, `ai_enabled` and `owner`.

## 3. Error code catalogue

| HTTP | `code` | When | Client behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | `bad_request` | Malformed JSON or query | Fix request |
| 400 | `idempotency_key_required` | Missing header on a required route | Generate and retry |
| 401 | `unauthenticated` | No or invalid token | Refresh once, then sign-in |
| 401 | `token_expired` | JWT past `exp` | Refresh and retry |
| 402 | `insufficient_credits` | Balance below action price | Show credit sheet with `credits` and `paywall` |
| 402 | `payment_required` | Feature needs a paid tier or pass | Show paywall from `paywall` |

| 403 | `limit_reached` | Quota hit (active trips, routes, alerts, collaborators) | Paywall or explain |
| 403 | `account_inactive` | `users.status` is `suspended` (an owner decision in the admin console) or `deleted` | Show support contact |
| 403 | `account_pending_deletion` | In 30 day grace | Offer cancel |
| 403 | `ai_consent_required` | No `ai_processing` consent | Show consent screen |
| 403 | `ai_disabled_for_trip` | Owner turned AI off | Explain |
| 404 | `not_found` | Missing or not a member | Generic not found |
| 405 | `method_not_allowed` | Wrong method | Bug |

| 410 | `invite_expired` | Invite past expiry, revoked or used up | Ask for a new invite |
| 410 | `share_link_revoked` | Share link revoked or expired | Show gone page |
| 412 | `precondition_failed` | `If-Match` not parseable | Bug |
| 413 | `payload_too_large` | Body over limit (1 MB JSON, 10 MB upload) | Shrink |
| 422 | `validation_failed` | Field errors in `errors` | Show field messages |

| 428 | `precondition_required` | Versioned write without `If-Match` | Bug |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | Limit hit | Back off per `Retry-After` |
| 429 | `provider_budget_exhausted` | Daily or monthly provider-spend ceiling | Explain, show cached data |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Unhandled | Retry, report `request_id` |
| 502 | `provider_error` | Upstream (Anthropic, SerpApi, Travelpayouts) failed; credits released | Retry later |
| 503 | `feature_disabled` | Kill switch | Show notice |
| 503 | `provider_unavailable` | Upstream down | Show cached data |
| 504 | `provider_timeout` | Upstream timed out; credits released | Retry |

Webhook endpoints use a smaller set: `401 invalid_signature`, `400 bad_payload`, `200` for duplicates and unhandled event types, `500` only for retryable failures so the sender retries.

## 4. Gates and costs at a glance

Gate codes used in the endpoint tables. A call that fails a gate returns the error shown, with `paywall` set.

| Gate | Passes when | Failure |
|---|---|---|
| none | Any signed-in user | n/a |
| `member(role)` | Caller is a member at or above `role` | 404 or `insufficient_role` |
| `can_invite` | Trip capabilities say `can_invite` (owner Plus or better, or a pass) | 403 `entitlement_required`, reason `sharing` |
| `active_trips` | Owner is under `plans.limits.active_trips` (Free 2, Plus and Family 25, Pro 50); a trip with an active pass does not count (limit key `active_trips_bonus`, 03 section 7.5) | 403 `limit_reached`, reason `trip_limit` |
| `live_route` | `live_routes_used < live_routes_max` and within 120 days of departure | 403 `limit_reached`, reason `live_routes` |
| `group_tools` | The trip's merged limits have `polls` and `cost_splitting` (owner on Plus, Family or Pro, or a Trip Pass or Group Trip Pass on the trip; Free owners only on trips that already have them) | 403 `entitlement_required`, reason `group_tools` |
| `group_payments` | Phase 4: flag `group_payments` on, and the trip has a Group Trip Pass or the owner is on Pro | 403 `entitlement_required`, reason `group_payments` |
| `ai` | `ai_processing` consent, trip `ai_enabled`, kill switch open | `ai_consent_required`, `ai_disabled_for_trip`, `feature_disabled` |
| `credits(n)` | Spendable credits at least `n` (`reserve_credits`, which raises SQLSTATE `WF402` when short) and provider ceiling has headroom | 402 `insufficient_credits` or 429 `provider_budget_exhausted` |
| `taster` | Free user has not used the lifetime deep run | 402 `payment_required`, reason `agent_taster_used` |
| `pro` | Caller's tier is `pro` (and flag `tier_pro` is on) | 403 `entitlement_required`, reason `routines` |
| `admin(role)` | Caller is an `admin_users` row with the role | 404 (routes are hidden) |

Credit prices (README, final): `explain` 1, `live_search` 1, `draft_day` 1, `draft_trip` 4, `research` 8 (1 from shared cache), `agent_run` 40 (8 from shared cache). Hard stops are enforced in the worker, not the API. Credit-spending endpoints reserve before work, settle after, and release on `provider_error`, `provider_timeout` or cancellation before a result.

## 5. Endpoints by module

Table columns: **Endpoint** (method and path), **Auth** (minimum role, all require a bearer token unless stated), **Gate and cost**, **Request and response**, **Errors and side effects**. "Standard errors" means 401, 404 (non-member), 422, 429, 500. Bodies are shown in the schema block under each table. A trailing `?` marks an optional field.

### 5.1 Auth and session bootstrap

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /me/bootstrap` | JWT, no users row needed | none | `BootstrapIn` to `Me` (201 new, 200 existing; 409 `email_in_use` when the email belongs to another account) | Calls the `bootstrap_user` function (03), which creates `users`, `auth_identities`, the "Me" `people` row and a `free` `entitlements` row. No credit grant is written yet: the 12 Free credits are written on the first credit use of each month (`ensure_free_monthly_grant`, 03 section 5.13) and the taster grant at its first offer. Records Apple relay email flag. Emits `user_signed_up`. |
| `GET /me` | user | none | `Me` | Returns server clock, `min_client_version`, feature flags evaluated for the user, and pending deletion state. Polled on foreground. |
| `POST /me/claim` | user | none | `{ guest_token, merge?: boolean }` to `ClaimResult` | Validates the signed guest token (App Attest assertion inside). Imports the guest's local trip (one) and people. If identity already owns data and `merge` is absent: `409 state_conflict` with counts in `detail`. |
| `POST /me/sign-out` | user | none | none to 204 | Revokes the current device's refresh token and unregisters its push token. |
| `POST /me/sign-out-everywhere` | user, recent auth | none | none to 204 | Revokes all devices and sessions, marks `devices.revoked_at`. Audit event. |
| `GET /me/devices` | user | none | none to `Device[]` | Lists signed-in devices. |
| `PUT /me/devices/{device_id}` | user | none | `DeviceIn` to `Device` | Registers or updates a device row (`devices.id`). Stores the push token (`push_token`, `push_environment`), `platform`, `app_version` and `os_version`; locale and notification prefs are saved on `users` and `users.prefs`. |
| `DELETE /me/devices/{device_id}` | user | none | 204 | Revokes that device's session. |
| `PUT /me/push-token` | user | none | `{ device_id, push_token, push_environment: "sandbox" \| "production" }` to 204 | Sets the token on the device. Invalid tokens are cleared when APNs answers 410. |
| `GET /health/live` | none | none | `{ status: "ok", version }` | Liveness, served at the host root (not under `/v1`). No auth, no rate limit headers. |
| `GET /health/ready` | none | none | `{ status: "ok" \| "degraded", checks: { database, migrations, queue } }` | Readiness: Postgres reachable, Alembic revision at head, queue reachable; 503 when any check fails (deploys roll back on it). Same rules as `/health/live`. |

```ts

  display_name?: string; locale?: string; timezone?: string

### 5.2 Account: profile, consents, export, deletion

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PATCH /me/profile` | user | none | `ProfileUpdate` to `Me` | Updates display name, locale, timezone, home currency and airports. Also updates the "Me" person's name and home airports. |
| `GET /me/settings` | user | none | none to `UserSettings` | Per-user settings (replaces the global `AppSetting`). |
| `PUT /me/settings` | user | none | `UserSettings` to `UserSettings` | Full replace. |
| `GET /me/consents` | user | none | none to `Consent[]` | Current accepted versions and withdrawals. |
| `PUT /me/consents/{kind}` | user | none | `{ version: string, granted: boolean }` to `Consent` | Kinds (`consents.kind`): `terms`, `privacy`, `ai_processing`, `marketing_email`, `push_notifications`, `analytics`, `concierge_sharing`. Appends a `consents` row (history kept). Withdrawing `ai_processing` makes every AI endpoint return `ai_consent_required`; running agent runs are cancelled. Marketing opt-out also honors one-click unsubscribe. |
| `POST /me/export` | user, re-auth within 10 minutes | 1 per day | none to 202 `DataExport` | Inserts `data_exports`, enqueues the export job. Zip of JSON plus a CSV or PDF per trip, emailed as a signed link valid 7 days. `429 rate_limited` on a second request within a day. |
| `GET /me/export` | user | none | none to `DataExport[]` | Status list (`data_exports.status`): `requested`, `processing`, `ready`, `expired`, `failed`. |
| `GET /me/export/{export_id}/download` | user | none | 302 to a signed R2 URL (5 minutes) | `410` if expired. |
| `POST /me/deletion` | user, re-auth within 10 minutes | 1 per day | `{ confirm: "DELETE", transfers?: { trip_id: Uuid, new_owner_id: Uuid }[], delete_trip_ids?: Uuid[] }` to 202 `DeletionRequest` | Inserts `deletion_requests`. At once: sessions and refresh tokens revoked, Apple token revoked, push tokens cleared, pending invites cancelled, status `pending_deletion`. Sole-owner trips with other members and no choice: 30 day wait for a member to accept a transfer, then deleted. Hard purge at 30 days. Does not cancel store subscriptions (response includes `manage_subscription_url`). |
| `POST /me/deletion/cancel` | user | within grace | none to `Me` | Restores `active`. Sessions stay revoked; the user signs in again. |
| `GET /me/deletion` | user | none | none to `DeletionRequest \| null` | Progress checklist and purge date. |
| `DELETE /me/ai-history` | user | none | none to 204 | Deletes stored prompt and response content for the user's runs (metadata kept for billing). |

### 5.3 Households (Family)

A household belongs to a Family subscriber and shares the tier, the pooled 150 credits and 5 live routes across up to 6 members. Trips stay per-trip membership; the household only shares entitlements and the credit pool.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /households/current` | user | none | none to `Household \| null` | Household the caller belongs to, with members and pooled credit balance. |
| `POST /households` | user with tier `family` | Family | `{ name: string }` to 201 `Household` | Creates `households` and an `owner` `household_members` row. One household per Family subscription. |
| `PATCH /households/{id}` | household owner | none | `{ name? }` to `Household` | Rename. |
| `POST /households/{id}/invites` | household owner | seats left under 6 | `{ email?: string }` to 201 `HouseholdInvite` | Universal link `https://wayfold.app/h/<token>`, 7 day expiry, single use. Email sent through Resend when `email` is set. |
| `POST /household-invites/{token}/accept` | user | none | none to `Household` | Joins; entitlements recomputed (member gets Family tier, draws from the pool). Fails with `410 invite_expired`, `403 limit_reached` (6 seats), `409 already_member`. A user with their own paid sub is told their sub keeps running and stays separate. |
| `DELETE /households/{id}/members/{user_id}` | household owner, or the member themself | none | 204 | Removes member; their entitlements recomputed at once. The owner cannot be removed while others remain. |
| `DELETE /households/{id}` | household owner | none | 204 | Dissolves; members fall back to their own tier. |

```ts
type Household = {
  id: Uuid; name: string
  members: { user_id: Uuid; display_name: string | null; role: "owner" | "member"; joined_at: string }[]
  seats_total: 6; seats_used: number

### 5.4 Trips

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /trips` | user | none | `?status=&include=joined,owned&limit&cursor&updated_since` to `Page<TripSummary>` | Trips where the caller is a member, excluding soft-deleted. `ETag` supported. |
| `POST /trips` | user | `active_trips` | `TripCreate` to 201 `Trip` | Creates `trips`, the owner `trip_members` row, `trip_destinations`, and `trip_people` links. Free owner with 2 active trips gets 403 `limit_reached` (reason `trip_limit`, `free_path`: "Archive a trip or join trips other people plan"). Joined trips never count. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}` | viewer | none | none to `Trip` | `ETag` is the trip version. |
| `PATCH /trips/{trip_id}` | editor (status, `ai_enabled` and `editors_can_invite`: owner) | versioned | `TripUpdate` to `Trip` | Replaces destinations and travelers when sent. Changing dates re-derives `itinerary_days`; items on removed days become unscheduled, never deleted. Sets cover from the first destination image. |
| `DELETE /trips/{trip_id}` | owner | none | none to 204 | Soft delete (`deleted_at`), 30 days in trash. Cancels active agent runs and routines, revokes invites and share links. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/restore` | owner | within 30 days | none to `Trip` | Undeletes. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/transfer` | owner | target is a member | `{ new_owner_id: Uuid }` to `Trip` | New owner becomes `owner`, previous owner becomes `editor`. Capabilities re-evaluated against the new owner's tier; a lapsed tier yields `limited: true`. Notifies both. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/leave` | member (not owner) | none | none to 204 | Removes the caller; contributions stay attributed to "Former member". Owner must transfer first (`409 state_conflict`). |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/refresh-info` | editor | none | none to 202 | Re-fetches destination summaries and images (Wikipedia, Geoapify). No credits, counted against a per-trip daily limit. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/activity` | viewer | none | `?limit&cursor` to `Page<ActivityEvent>` | Reverse-chronological change feed ("Sam added Hotel Avenida"). |

```ts

```

### 5.5 Destinations

Destinations are nested in `Trip` and edited through `PATCH /trips/{id}`; these routes are for single-item edits and for typeahead.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /geo/destinations` | user | none | `?q=&limit=8` to `DestinationSuggestion[]` | Typeahead over Geoapify geocoding (cached in `places_cache`). Per-user quota. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/destinations` | viewer | none | none to `Destination[]` | Ordered. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/destinations` | editor | max 12 | `DestinationIn` to 201 `Destination` | Appends; enqueues summary and image fetch (`info_status: "pending"`). |
| `PATCH /trips/{trip_id}/destinations/{destination_id}` | editor | none | `Partial<DestinationIn>` to `Destination` | |
| `DELETE /trips/{trip_id}/destinations/{destination_id}` | editor | none | 204 | Days pointing at it get `destination_id: null`. |
| `PUT /trips/{trip_id}/destinations/order` | editor | none | `{ ids: Uuid[] }` to `Destination[]` | Must contain every id exactly once. |
| `GET /airports` | user | none | `?q=&limit=10` to `Airport[]` | From `airports`. Cached 24 hours (`Cache-Control: private, max-age=86400`). |
| `GET /airports/nearby` | user | none | `?lat&lon&radius_km=150` to `NearbyAirport[]` | Used only when the user taps "near me"; coordinates are not stored. |

```ts
type Destination = DestinationIn & {
  id: Uuid; position: number; summary: string | null; wiki_url: string | null
  image_url: string | null; info_status: "pending" | "ready" | "not_found" | "failed" | "skipped"

```

### 5.6 Members, invites and share links

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/members` | viewer | none | none to `Member[]` | Includes pending invites for owners. |
| `PATCH /trips/{trip_id}/members/{user_id}` | owner | `can_invite` for new editors | `{ role: "editor" \| "viewer" }` to `Member` | Cannot set `owner` (use transfer). Limited trips cannot raise a role. |
| `DELETE /trips/{trip_id}/members/{user_id}` | owner | none | none to 204 | Access ends immediately. Linked person detached ("Former member" option). |
| `PUT /trips/{trip_id}/members/me/traveler` | member | none | `{ person_id: Uuid }` to `Member` | Answers "Which traveler are you?"; sets `people.linked_user_id`. A person links to one user per trip. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/invites` | owner (editors: viewer invites only if `editors_can_invite`) | `can_invite`, collaborator cap, 30 per day, 20 pending | `InviteCreate` to 201 `Invite` | Random 128 bit token, stored hashed. The raw token appears only in this response and the emailed link. Email sent when `email` set. Over cap: 403 `limit_reached` reason `traveler_limit` or `sharing` with a paywall hint. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/invites` | owner | none | none to `Invite[]` | No tokens. |
| `DELETE /trips/{trip_id}/invites/{invite_id}` | owner | none | 204 | Revokes. |
| `GET /invites/{token}` | none (rate limited) | none | none to `InvitePreview` | Public preview for the landing page: trip name, cover, inviter display name, role. No dates or places. `410 invite_expired` for bad tokens (same response for unknown and expired). |
| `POST /invites/{token}/accept` | user | none | `{ person_id?: Uuid }` to 200 `Trip` | Redeems server side; the email need not match (Apple relay). Adds `trip_members`; single-use invites are consumed; link invites increment `use_count` up to `max_uses`. Free accounts join free and do not count toward their 2 active trips. `409 already_member` returns the trip id. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/share-links` | owner | none | none to `ShareLink[]` | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/share-links` | owner | `can_invite` | `ShareLinkCreate` to 201 `ShareLink` | Read-only public link `https://wayfold.app/s/<token>`. Default expiry 90 days (maximum 365). Redaction flags hide hotel address, prices and notes by default. |
| `PATCH /trips/{trip_id}/share-links/{link_id}` | owner | none | `Partial<ShareLinkCreate>` to `ShareLink` | |
| `DELETE /trips/{trip_id}/share-links/{link_id}` | owner | none | 204 | Revokes; later views return `410 share_link_revoked`. |
| `GET /shared/{token}` | none (per-IP and per-token limit) | none | none to `SharedTrip` | Public read of the redacted presentation data (5.15). `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60`. Never includes affiliate click ids; the "Book the plan" slide links come from `POST /shared/{token}/outbound` (5.21). |

```ts
type Member = {
  user_id: Uuid; display_name: string | null; role: Role
  person_id: Uuid | null; joined_at: string; invited_by: Attribution | null

type SharedTrip = { trip_name: string; presentation: Presentation; cta: { label: "Get the app to edit"; url: string }; book_slide: AffiliateOffer[] | null }
```

### 5.7 People

A person is a traveler profile owned by a user. It is planning data, not an account. Names of people who are not members never go to AI providers ("Traveler 1" is used instead).

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /people` | user | none | none to `Person[]` | The caller's own people plus linked people visible through shared trips (co-members only). |
| `POST /people` | user | max 30 per user | `PersonIn` to 201 `Person` | `owner_user_id` is the caller. |
| `PUT /people/{person_id}` | owner of the person | none | `PersonIn` to `Person` | Linked people can only be edited by their own user for name and airports. |
| `DELETE /people/{person_id}` | owner of the person | none | 204 | `409 state_conflict` if the person is the only traveler on a trip the caller does not own; otherwise removed from `trip_people`, historic votes keep "Former traveler". |
| `PUT /trips/{trip_id}/travelers` | editor | none | `{ person_ids: Uuid[] }` to `Person[]` | Replaces `trip_people` for the trip (capped by `travelers_per_trip`: Free 2, Plus, Family and Trip Pass 8, Pro and Group Trip Pass 12; over the cap is 403 `limit_reached`, reason `traveler_limit`). |

```ts
type PersonIn = { name: string /* 1..60 */; color: string /* #rrggbb */; home_airports: Iata[] /* max 6 */ }
type Person = PersonIn & { id: Uuid; linked_user_id: Uuid | null; is_me: boolean }
```

### 5.8 Flights

Flight data follows the existing route and quote model. A route is a search definition; fare observations are quotes seen by a source. Cached fares (Travelpayouts Data API) are available to every tier; live fares (SerpApi behind a provider interface, flag `serpapi_live_fares`) need a live route slot and cost 1 credit per user-triggered live check. The scheduled daily live check of a tracked route does not cost credits; it draws on the route slot and the provider-spend ceiling. Sorting is by price only; providers never influence order.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/routes` | viewer | none | none to `Route[]` | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/routes` | editor | `routes_per_trip` cap (Free 1, Plus and Family 5, Pro 8, passes 3; `limit_reached`, reason `live_routes` only when `mode: "live"`) | `RouteIn` to 201 `Route` | `mode: "cached"` (default) uses Travelpayouts only. `mode: "live"` needs a free live slot and departure within 120 days, else 403 `limit_reached`. Enqueues a first cached refresh. |
| `PUT /routes/{route_id}` | editor | versioned | `RouteIn` to `Route` | Switching `mode` to `live` re-checks the gate. Changing search fields clears nothing; old observations stay. |
| `DELETE /routes/{route_id}` | editor | none | 204 | Frees the live slot. Observations kept 13 months for history. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/flights/refresh` | editor | none (cached only) | `{ route_ids?: Uuid[] }` to 202 `Job` | Refreshes cached fares for these routes (max 20). Does not call live providers. Per-trip limit 10 an hour. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/flights/live-search` | editor | `live_route` (route in `live` mode), `credits(1)` | `{ route_id: Uuid }` with `Idempotency-Key` to 202 `LiveSearchJob` | Reserves 1 credit (`live_search`), enqueues a SerpApi call, writes `provider_calls` and `fare_observations`. Settles on success; releases on `provider_error`. For trips with a pass, also increments `trip_passes.live_checks_used` (`live_checks_max`, 60). Returns `from_cache: true` and charges 0 when a fresh observation (under 6 hours) already exists in the shared cache. 402, 429 `provider_budget_exhausted`, 403 `limit_reached`. |
| `GET /live-search/{job_id}` | the caller | none | none to `LiveSearchJob` | Poll until `done` or `failed`. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/flights/best` | viewer | none | `?route_id=&limit=20&include_hidden=false&sort=price` to `Fare[]` | Sorted by price ascending then observed time. `sort` accepts `price`, `duration`, `stops` only. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/flights/summary` | viewer | none | none to `RouteSummary[]` | Cheapest fare, last check time, fare count and chosen fare per route. `ETag`. |
| `GET /routes/{route_id}/fares` | viewer | none | `?limit&cursor&source=&since=` to `Page<Fare>` | All observations. |
| `PATCH /fares/{fare_id}` | editor | none | `{ hidden?: boolean, suspect?: boolean }` to `Fare` | Hides or flags a fare for this trip (`trip_fare_links`), never deletes shared data. |
| `GET /routes/{route_id}/price-history` | viewer | none | none to `PriceHistory` | Daily minimum by source, typical low and high, price level. |
| `GET /routes/{route_id}/date-grid` | viewer | none | none to `DateGridCell[]` | Cheapest fare per departure and return pair. |
| `PUT /routes/{route_id}/choice` | editor | none | `{ fare_id: Uuid }` to `Trip` | Writes `chosen_flights`. Trip dates derive from chosen flights when dates are unset. Checklist items "Flights booked", "Airport transfer" and "Travel insurance" become visible (5.16). Emits `flight_chosen`. |
| `DELETE /routes/{route_id}/choice` | editor | none | none to `Trip` | |
| `POST /routes/{route_id}/choice/booked` | editor | none | `{ booked: boolean }` to `Trip` | Marks the chosen flight as booked by the user (used by the checklist and the after-trip prompt). |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/price-alerts` | viewer | none | none to `PriceAlert[]` | |
| `POST /routes/{route_id}/price-alerts` | editor | `price_alerts` cap per account (Free 1, cached fares only; Plus and Family 3, Pro 6; a pass gives 2 on its trip) | `PriceAlertIn` to 201 `PriceAlert` | Writes `price_alerts`. Free alerts run on cached fares only and never trigger live calls. `403 limit_reached` with a paywall hint otherwise. |
| `PATCH /price-alerts/{alert_id}` | editor | none | `Partial<PriceAlertIn>` to `PriceAlert` | |
| `DELETE /price-alerts/{alert_id}` | editor | none | 204 | |

### 5.9 Lodging

Lodging covers options the user saves or pastes, votes, comparison, and rental search. Rule: the server never fetches Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking.com pages, and never rewrites a pasted link. `url` is stored exactly as pasted.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/lodging` | viewer | none | `?status=&sort=created&limit&cursor&updated_since` to `Page<Lodging>` | `sort` accepts `created`, `price`, `rating`, `votes`. The response states the sort in `sorted_by`. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/lodging` | editor | none | `LodgingIn` to 201 `Lodging` | Writes `lodging_options`. Stores `site` from the host of `url`. `added_via`: `paste`, `bookmarklet`, `partner_search`, `agent`, `manual`. Activity feed entry. |
| `GET /lodging/{option_id}` | viewer | none | none to `Lodging` | |
| `PATCH /lodging/{option_id}` | editor | versioned | `Partial<LodgingIn>` to `Lodging` | `status` moving to `booked` also offers to add the stay to the itinerary days (client prompt; no server side effect). |
| `DELETE /lodging/{option_id}` | editor | none | 204 | Removes votes. |
| `PUT /lodging/{option_id}/votes/me` | viewer | none | `{ voted: boolean }` to `Lodging` | Adds or removes the caller's heart in `lodging_votes` (`user_id`, and the linked `person_id`). Viewers may vote. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/lodging/compare` | viewer | none | `?ids=a,b,c` (2 to 4) to `LodgingCompare` | Side by side table: price per night and total in trip home currency, rating, bedrooms, beds, baths, distance to destination center and to chosen itinerary anchors, votes, pros and cons. Sorted by the order of `ids`, never by commission. |
| `POST /lodging/parse-link` | user | none | `{ url: string, check_in?, check_out?, guests? }` to `LinkParse` | Parses only the URL text: host, stay dates and guests in query parameters, listing id. No network request to the host. Blocked-host rule: for `airbnb.*`, `vrbo.*`, `booking.*` and the Expedia Group brands the response has `fetch_allowed: false`; `title`, `photos` and `description` are always empty for them and the client asks the user to type or use the bookmarklet. Any request that sets a `fetch` flag on these hosts gets `422 blocked_domain`. For other hosts it never fetches either in the hosted API; link previews are disabled server side and come only from the user's own clipboard or bookmarklet payload. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/lodging/rental-search` | editor | `credits(1)` (`live_search`), shared cache free for 6 hours | `RentalSearchIn` with `Idempotency-Key` to `RentalSearchResult` | Searches licensed sources only (SerpApi Google Vacation Rentals through the provider interface, Stay22 and partner search). Reserves 1 credit; repeats of the same search within 6 hours return `cached: true` and charge 0. Sorted by `price` or `rating` only, with the sort statement in `sorted_by`. Writes `provider_calls`. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/lodging/from-offer` | editor | none | `{ offer_ref: string }` to 201 `Lodging` | Saves an offer from a search result (`offer_ref` is an opaque server token valid 24 hours). Sets `added_via: "partner_search"` and stores the partner book offer separately from the user's `url`. |
| `GET /lodging/{option_id}/book-offers` | viewer | none | none to `AffiliateOffer[]` | Labeled partner "Book via partner" button and "Compare on other sites" search links built from URL text and trip dates, without fetching. Empty for Airbnb (plain links only) and when `hide_booking_links` is set returns plain "Open on partner site" links. |

### 5.10 Itinerary

The itinerary is `itinerary_days` (one per trip date, created from the trip dates) and `itinerary_items` (an activity, meal, transport, stay or note entry, scheduled or in the unscheduled pool). This replaces the existing `/activities` routes.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/days` | viewer | none | `?updated_since` to `Day[]` | Every date in the trip range, with counts and first and last items. Days outside the range that hold items are included with `in_trip: false`. `ETag`. |
| `PUT /trips/{trip_id}/days/{day}` | editor | versioned | `DayUpdate` to `Day` | `day` is `YYYY-MM-DD`. Creates the row if needed. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/items` | viewer | none | `?day=&unscheduled=true&category=&limit&cursor&updated_since` to `Page<Item>` | Ordered by day, then `sort_order`. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/items` | editor | none | `ItemIn` to 201 `Item` | Appends to the end of the day (or the pool) with the next `sort_order`. If `place` is given, saves it to `saved_places` when not present and stores `source: "place_search"`; otherwise `source: "manual"`. Fails `422 validation_failed` if `end_time` precedes `start_time`. |
| `GET /items/{item_id}` | viewer | none | none to `Item` | |
| `PATCH /items/{item_id}` | editor | versioned | `ItemUpdate` to `Item` | Moving `day` is allowed here for a simple change; use `/move` to also set `sort_order`. |
| `DELETE /items/{item_id}` | editor | versioned | 204 | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/days/{day}/reorder` | editor | none | `{ ids: Uuid[], version_map?: Record<Uuid, number> }` to `Item[]` | Sets `sort_order` by order for every item on that day. `ids` must be exactly the current items of the day else `409 version_conflict` with the current order in `current`. |
| `POST /items/{item_id}/move` | editor | versioned | `{ day: string \| null, before_id?: Uuid \| null, start_time?: string \| null }` to `Item[]` | Moves between days or to the pool (`day: null`) and places before `before_id` (end if null). Returns every item whose position changed on both days. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/items/bulk` | editor | max 50 | `{ items: ItemIn[], source?: "ai_draft" \| "import" }` to 201 `Item[]` | Used when accepting an AI draft or a booking import (`source` is stored on each item). One transaction. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/items/{item_id}/book-offers` | viewer | none | none to `AffiliateOffer[]` | "Tickets" offers for bookable items (Viator match by name and coordinates). Empty for parks and viewpoints. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/days/{day}/suggestions` | viewer | none | none to `ThingToDo[]` | Viator "things to do" near the day's plan, sorted by rating then distance, labeled as suggestions. Empty when there is no real match. No credits. |

### 5.11 Places

Geoapify is the place source; results are cached in `places_cache` per provider terms. Results are ranked by relevance and distance only. Saving a place never calls a paid provider.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /places/search` | user | per-user quota (200 an hour) | `?q=&lat=&lon=&radius_m=&category=&destination_id=&trip_id=&limit=20` to `PlaceSearchResult` | Text or category search around a point or the destination boundary (`geoapify_place_id`). Response includes the required attribution string and `cached`. `429` on quota. |
| `GET /places/{place_id}` | user | none | none to `PlaceDetails` | `place_id` is our id (`geoapify:<id>`). Adds Wikipedia summary when `wikidata` or `wikipedia` tags exist. Cached per terms. |
| `GET /places/{place_id}/book-offers` | user | none | none to `AffiliateOffer[]` | "Tickets" or "Book a table" chips on the detail view only, when a real match exists. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/saved-places` | viewer | none | `?limit&cursor` to `Page<SavedPlace>` | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/saved-places` | editor | none | `{ place_id: string, note?: string }` to 201 `SavedPlace` | Writes `saved_places` (idempotent on trip and place). |
| `DELETE /trips/{trip_id}/saved-places/{saved_id}` | editor | none | 204 | |

```ts
type Place = {
  id: string; provider: "geoapify"; name: string; local_name: string | null

```

### 5.12 AI: one-shot actions

One-shot actions run inline or as a short job. All need the `ai` gate (consent, trip toggle, kill switch) and reserve credits first. They use Claude Haiku 4.5 for `explain` and Claude Sonnet 5.5 for the rest. Output carries source URLs for every fact found on the web. The AI never gives insurance, visa or legal advice and links to official sources instead, and never mentions a partner.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/ai/explain` | editor | `ai`, `credits(1)` (`explain`) | `{ question: string, context?: { item_id?: Uuid, lodging_id?: Uuid, place_id?: string } }` with `Idempotency-Key` to `ExplainResult` | Haiku short answer (under 120 words) with optional sources. Reserves 1 credit. Private notes are excluded from context. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/ai/draft-day` | editor | `ai`, `credits(1)` (`draft_day`) | `{ day: string, preferences?: string, replace?: boolean }` with `Idempotency-Key` to `DraftDayResult` | Returns a draft list of `ItemIn`, not saved. Applying it is `POST /trips/{trip_id}/items/bulk`. Hard stop $0.03. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/ai/draft-trip` | editor | `ai`, `credits(4)` (`draft_trip`) | `{ style?: string, pace?: "relaxed" \| "balanced" \| "packed", interests?: string[], budget?: Money }` with `Idempotency-Key` to 202 `DraftJob` | Whole-trip draft (days and items, plus a "why" per day). Runs as a job; poll `GET /ai/jobs/{id}`. Hard stop $0.10. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/ai/research` | editor | `ai`, `credits(8)`, or `credits(1)` if served from `shared_research_cache` (`research`) | `{ topic?: "destination_brief" \| "events_and_closures" \| "reservations_needed" \| "getting_around" \| "seasonal_notes", question?: string, scope?: "destination" \| "dates" \| "lodging" }` (a fixed `topic` can be served from the shared cache; a custom `question` bypasses it) with `Idempotency-Key` to 202 `ResearchJob` | Sonnet with 5 searches and 8 fetches at most, hard stop $0.16. Cache hit returns instantly with `from_cache: true` and charges 1. The shared cache stores only public facts keyed by destination, topic and date bucket, never personal context. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/ai/packing-list` | editor | `ai`, `credits(1)` (`explain` price class) | `{ preferences?: string }` with `Idempotency-Key` to `PackingListResult` | One short Haiku call from destination, dates, weather numbers and activity categories; the run is stored as `runs.kind = 'packing_list'`. Nothing is saved until the user adds lines with `POST /trips/{trip_id}/checklist/packing` (5.16). |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/ai/booking-import` | editor | `ai`, `credits(1)` (`explain` price class) | `{ text: string /* max 12000 */ }` with `Idempotency-Key` to `BookingImportResult` | Parses pasted confirmation text (personal data is replaced by placeholders before the call) into a draft flight, stay or itinerary item; the server never fetches a URL in the text. the run is stored as `runs.kind = 'booking_import'`. Nothing is saved until the user accepts; accepted drafts are created through the normal routes: a flight becomes an itinerary item (`category: "travel"`, `status: "booked"`, `source: "import"`), a stay a lodging option (`added_via: "manual"`, `status: "booked"`) and an activity an itinerary item (`source: "import"`). |
| `GET /ai/jobs/{job_id}` | the requester | none | none to `AiJob` | Poll a draft-trip or research job until `done`, `failed` or `cancelled`. |
| `POST /ai/jobs/{job_id}/cancel` | the requester | none | none to `AiJob` | Releases unspent reservation if no result was produced. |

```ts
type ExplainResult = { answer: string; sources: Source[]; credits: CreditReceipt }
type Source = { url: string; title: string | null; fetched_at: string }
type PackingListResult = { items: { label: string; group: string }[]; credits: CreditReceipt }

type ResearchJob = AiJob<{ answer: string; findings: { text: string; source: Source }[]; from_cache: boolean }>
```

### 5.13 AI: agent runs, routines and taster

Agent runs are the fare hunt and deep research agents from the existing app, now metered API calls in our worker. A run is a row in `runs`; its events are `run_events`. One run at a time per account, 20 turns, 10 searches, 10 fetches, hard stop $0.80. Admission needs $0.80 of monthly provider headroom even if the daily budget is spent. Every fare an agent saves must have been seen on a page during the run, and every note links its source URL (evidence rules carry over from `agent_ingest`).

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/agent-runs` | editor | `ai`, `credits(40)` (8 from shared cache), or `taster` (free user, once per lifetime), one active run per account | `AgentRunStart` with `Idempotency-Key` to 202 `AgentRun` | Reserves credits, inserts `runs` (status `queued`), enqueues the job, sets `Location` to the run and returns `events_url`. Taster: spends the user's one-time `promo` grant (`restricted_action = 'agent_run'`) when the run starts; the grant is returned only if the run fails before its first tool call. `409 run_already_active` (body has the active run id), 402 `insufficient_credits`, 402 `payment_required` with reason `agent_taster_used`, 429 `provider_budget_exhausted`, 403 `ai_consent_required`. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/agent-runs` | viewer | none | `?status=&kind=&limit&cursor` to `Page<AgentRun>` | All runs on the trip, including others' (members see run summaries; prompts and raw logs only the starter and the owner). |
| `GET /agent-runs/{run_id}` | viewer on the trip | none | none to `AgentRunDetail` | Summary, counts, cost estimate (starter only), credit receipt. |
| `GET /agent-runs/{run_id}/events` | viewer on the trip | none | `?after_seq=0&limit=200` to `RunEvent[]` | Polling fallback for clients that cannot hold SSE. |
| `GET /agent-runs/{run_id}/stream` | viewer on the trip | none | SSE (see below) | `Content-Type: text/event-stream`. Replays from `Last-Event-ID`. Heartbeat comment every 15 seconds. Ends after `run.finished`. Does not count against rate limits once open (one stream per run per user, 3 per user). |
| `GET /agent-runs/{run_id}/outputs` | viewer on the trip | none | none to `RunOutputs` | Saved fares, notes (each with a source URL) and rejections (what was dropped and why). |
| `POST /agent-runs/{run_id}/cancel` | starter or owner | none | `Idempotency-Key` to `AgentRun` | Sets `cancel_requested`; the worker stops at the next checkpoint. Credits are settled for work done through `settle_credits` (charged pro rata by turns used, minimum 8 credits for a run that called tools, 0 if cancelled in the queue). `409 state_conflict` when already finished. |
| `DELETE /agent-runs/{run_id}` | starter or owner | finished runs only | 204 | Deletes stored prompt and log content; the `ai_usage` row stays. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/routines` | viewer | `pro` to see details, others get `[]` | none to `Routine[]` | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/routines` | editor | `pro` | `RoutineCreate` to 201 `Routine` | Scheduled agent routines are a Pro feature. Non-Pro gets 403 `entitlement_required`, reason `routines`. Schedule minimum is daily. The scheduler enqueues due routines; each firing charges the routine's creator 40 credits. A firing with too few credits is skipped and the owner is notified. |
| `GET /routines/{routine_id}` | viewer | `pro` | none to `Routine` | |
| `PATCH /routines/{routine_id}` | creator or owner | versioned | `RoutineUpdate` to `Routine` | |
| `DELETE /routines/{routine_id}` | creator or owner | none | 204 | Cancels queued firings. |
| `POST /routines/{routine_id}/run` | editor | `pro`, `credits(40)` | `Idempotency-Key` to 202 `AgentRun` | Runs now, with `trigger: "manual"`. |
| `GET /me/agent-taster` | user | none | none to `{ used: boolean, used_at: string | null, run_id: Uuid | null }` | Drives the "Try a deep run free" card. |

}
type AgentRunDetail = AgentRun & { cost_usd_micros?: number /* starter and admins only */ }
type RunEvent = {                               // type is the SSE event name, derived from run_events.type (info, warning, error, tool_use, tool_result, text, result, rejection) plus tool_name and payload.kind
  seq: number; ts: string

  last_run: AgentRun | null; owner: Attribution             // routines.owner_user_id
}
```

**SSE stream format.** Each event is one SSE message with an id equal to `seq`:

```
id: 14
event: fare.saved
data: {"seq":14,"ts":"2026-09-30T14:07:11Z","type":"fare.saved","tool_name":"submit_flight_quotes","summary":"Saved LIS round trip $412 on TAP, seen on tap.example","payload":{"fare_id":"0191..."}}

: heartbeat

id: 27
event: run.finished
data: {"seq":27,"type":"run.finished","summary":"2 fares and 1 note saved","payload":{"status":"succeeded","credits":{"reserved":40,"charged":31,"balance_after":29}}}
```

Clients reconnect with `Last-Event-ID`. `run.finished` is always the last event and carries the settled credit receipt. The stream authenticates with the normal bearer header (the iOS client uses a fetch-based reader, not `EventSource`); a short-lived `?stream_token=` (60 seconds, from `POST /agent-runs/{id}/stream-token`) is accepted for browsers that cannot set headers.

### 5.14 Notes and evidence

Notes are either user notes or agent findings. An agent note must carry at least one `source_url`; fares seen by an agent are evidence on the `Fare`.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/notes` | viewer | none | `?kind=&pinned=&limit&cursor&updated_since` to `Page<Note>` | Private notes of other users are omitted. |

Writes `content_reports` (`target_type` `agent_note` or `ai_answer`; when the run used the shared cache the `cache_key` is added server side). The report immediately expires that cache entry so it is no longer served; the third report from different users also flags it (03 section 5.11). The reporter is never shown to anyone but moderators. |
| `POST /shared/{token}/report` | none (share token) | 5 an hour per IP | `{ reason: ReportReason, detail?: string }` to 201 | Report a shared trip page (`target_type` `shared_trip`, `reporter_user_id` null). Reviewed in the admin moderation queue (08 6.12). |

### 5.15 Presentation data

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/presentation` | viewer | none | `?redact=` to `Presentation` | Everything the full-screen walkthrough needs in one payload: cover, destinations, days with items, chosen flights, booked stays, weather, and the pre-trip checklist summary. `ETag`. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/presentation/pdf` | viewer | none | none to 202 `Job` then 302 to a signed file | Print-ready PDF. Partner buttons are omitted by default (`?links=true` keeps them live with the commission sentence printed). |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/calendar.ics` | viewer | none | none to `text/calendar` | Subscribable feed, authenticated by a per-trip secret token in the query string (`?token=`, rotated by `POST /trips/{id}/calendar-token`). |

```ts
type Presentation = {

```

### 5.16 Checklist ("Before you go")

The checklist is derived from trip data by a rules module and stored as `checklist_items` only for state (done, dismissed, meta). At least half the items are unmonetized.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/checklist` | viewer | none | none to `ChecklistItem[]` | Appears when the trip has a chosen flight or a saved stay, or 45 days before departure. Each item says why it is shown. Affiliate items carry `offer` with the disclosure line. Emits `checklist_item_shown` once per item per session. |
| `PATCH /trips/{trip_id}/checklist/{kind}` | editor | versioned | `{ status: "todo" \| "done" \| "skipped" \| "not_needed", version?: number }` to `ChecklistItem` | Persists per trip. One nudge per item per week at most. |
| `PATCH /trips/{trip_id}/checklist/items/{item_id}` | editor | versioned | `{ status?: "todo" \| "done" \| "skipped" \| "not_needed", title?: string, version?: number }` to `ChecklistItem` | For custom items and AI packing lines, which have many rows per trip and so are addressed by id (rules items are addressed by `{kind}` above). |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/checklist/custom` | editor | none | `{ title: string }` to 201 `ChecklistItem` | User items (`kind: "custom"`, `source: "user"`). |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/checklist/packing` | editor | none | `{ items: { label: string, group: string }[] /* max 40 */ }` to 201 `ChecklistItem[]` | Saves the lines the user kept from a packing-list result as `kind: "packing"`, `source: "ai"`, `meta.group` set. Free; the credit was spent on the AI call. |
| `DELETE /trips/{trip_id}/checklist/{item_id}` | editor | custom items and AI packing lines only | 204 | |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/after-trip` | editor | trip end date passed | none to `AfterTrip` | "Was your flight delayed or cancelled?" prompt state. A partner link (compensation) is returned only after `PATCH` with `{ delayed: true }`. |
| `PATCH /trips/{trip_id}/after-trip` | editor | none | `{ delayed?: boolean, dismissed?: boolean }` to `AfterTrip` | |

```ts
type ChecklistKind = "flights_booked" | "stay_booked" | "tickets" | "transfer_or_car" | "esim" | "insurance"

### 5.17 Group tools: polls, votes, expenses, shares, settlements

Gate for the routes in this section: `group_tools` (polls and manual cost splitting are in Plus, Family, Pro, Trip Pass and Group Trip Pass; see section 4). Wayfold records who owes whom; any real money moves outside the app. Stripe collection is Phase 4, gated by `group_payments` (Group Trip Pass or Pro only), and never uses Apple In-App Purchase or unlocks a digital feature.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/polls` | viewer | none (read allowed on any tier once created) | `?status=` to `Poll[]` | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/polls` | editor | `group_tools` | `PollIn` to 201 `Poll` | Options may reference `lodging_options`, `itinerary_items` or free text; they are stored in `polls.options` (jsonb, each with a `key`). |
| `PATCH /polls/{poll_id}` | author or owner | versioned | `{ question?, closes_at?, status?: "open" \| "closed" }` to `Poll` | Closing sets `closed_at` and `winning_option_key` (ties are reported in `winners` and the key stays null). |
| `DELETE /polls/{poll_id}` | author or owner | none | 204 | |
| `PUT /polls/{poll_id}/votes/me` | viewer | poll open | `{ option_keys: string[] }` to `Poll` | Writes `poll_votes` (`option_key`). `single` polls accept one key, `multiple` polls any number of the options. Replaces the caller's previous vote. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/expenses` | viewer | none | `?limit&cursor` to `Page<Expense>` | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/expenses` | editor | `group_tools` | `ExpenseIn` with `Idempotency-Key` to 201 `Expense` | Writes `expenses` and `expense_shares`. Shares must sum to the amount (minor units, remainder to the payer). |
| `PATCH /expenses/{expense_id}` | author or owner | versioned | `Partial<ExpenseIn>` to `Expense` | Blocked once a settlement that includes it is `recorded` or `succeeded` (`409 state_conflict`). |
| `DELETE /expenses/{expense_id}` | author or owner | none | 204 | |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/balances` | viewer | none | none to `Balances` | Net per person and the minimal suggested transfers, in the trip home currency (FX from `fx_rates`, date shown). |

The other methods start `pending` and the recipient confirms them (status `recorded`). |
| `POST /settlements/{settlement_id}/confirm` | recipient | status `pending` | none to `Settlement` | Recipient confirms receipt; status becomes `recorded`. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/settlements` | viewer | none | none to `Settlement[]` | |

### 5.18 Concierge and room-block requests

Optional "Have a human book this" requests, fulfilled by an advisor under a host travel agency. Always disclosed and never required. Requests are free to send; the user perks and commission terms are in [07-monetization-spec.md](07-monetization-spec.md).

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/concierge-requests` | owner or editor | none | `ConciergeIn` with `Idempotency-Key` to 201 `ConciergeRequest` | Writes `concierge_requests` (status `submitted`), emails the advisor desk through Resend, and posts to the admin queue. Needs the `concierge_sharing` consent, recorded as `share_consent_at` on the request. Only the listed fields are shared with the advisor; other travelers' names are sent only if the requester includes them. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/concierge-requests` | viewer | none | none to `ConciergeRequest[]` | |
| `PATCH /concierge-requests/{id}` | requester | status `submitted`, `triaged` or `quoted` | `{ message?: string, cancel?: boolean }` to `ConciergeRequest` | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/room-block-requests` | owner | `room_block_request` capability (Group Trip Pass), at least 8 travelers | `RoomBlockIn` with `Idempotency-Key` to 201 `RoomBlockRequest` | Group Trip Pass feature. Writes `room_block_requests`, notifies the desk. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/room-block-requests` | viewer | none | none to `RoomBlockRequest[]` | |

```ts
type ConciergeIn = {
  kind: "stay" | "cruise" | "complex_trip" | "other"

### 5.19 Entitlements and credits

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /me/entitlements` | user | none | none to `Entitlements` | The one source the client reads for what the account can do. Derived from `entitlements`, `subscriptions`, `trip_passes` and the household. Never calls Apple. `ETag`. |
| `POST /purchases/sync` | user | none | `{ trip_id?: Uuid, product_id?: string }` with `Idempotency-Key` to `Entitlements` | Called after a purchase for instant unlock before the webhook lands. The server asks RevenueCat's REST API for the subscriber and applies the same code as the webhook. For a Trip Pass or Group Trip Pass, `trip_id` binds the pass (it can move once, see `/me/passes/{pass_id}/move`). |
| `POST /purchases/restore` | user | none | none to `Entitlements` | Re-pulls the subscriber after "Restore purchases". |
| `GET /me/credits` | user | none | none to `CreditBalance` | Balance split by source, expiry dates and next monthly grant. Family members see the household pool. |
| `GET /me/credits/ledger` | user | none | `?limit&cursor&kind=` to `Page<LedgerEntry>` | From `credit_ledger`, newest first; `kind` filters `entry_type`. |
| `GET /credits/packs` | user | none | none to `CreditPack[]` | `credits_50`, `credits_150`, `credits_400` (plan codes) with their store product ids (`wayfold_credits_50` and so on). The price is shown by StoreKit, not by us. |
| `POST /credits/packs/claim` | user | none | `{ product_id: string, transaction_id: string }` with `Idempotency-Key` to `CreditBalance` | Verifies the transaction through RevenueCat, grants credits keyed by `transaction_id` (never twice). Usually already granted by the webhook; this returns the balance. `409 state_conflict` if the transaction belongs to another user. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/pass` | viewer | none | none to `TripPass \| null` | Pass status and expiry for the trip settings screen. |
| `GET /me/passes` | user | none | none to `TripPass[]` | Includes an unapplied pass waiting to be bound to a trip (a `store_transactions` row with `kind = 'pass'` and no `trip_passes` row yet). |
| `POST /me/passes/{pass_id}/bind` | user (trip owner) | none | `{ trip_id: Uuid }` with `Idempotency-Key` to `TripPass` | Binds an unapplied pass to a trip the caller owns (the purchaser must be the owner): inserts `trip_passes` (`starts_at` now, `expires_at` plus 90 days, limits copied from `plans.limits`), writes the `trip_pass` credit grant, recomputes capabilities. `409 state_conflict` if the trip already has an active pass of the same plan, or if the pass is a Trip Pass and the trip has a Group Trip Pass. Binding a Group Trip Pass to a trip with an active Trip Pass is an upgrade: the Trip Pass becomes `upgraded`, the new pass runs a full 90 days from now, carries over `live_checks_used`, and the old pass's unspent credits stay spendable until their own expiry (07 7.9). |
| `POST /me/passes/{pass_id}/move` | user (trip owner) | none | `{ trip_id: Uuid }` to `TripPass` | Moves an active pass to another trip the caller owns, once (`move_count`). Keeps `expires_at`, moves unspent pass credits and the live-check counter. `409 state_conflict` on a second move. |

```ts
type Entitlements = {
  tier: Tier; source: "none" | "subscription" | "household" | "comp" | "advisor"

}
```

### 5.20 Paywall offers

The server decides which offer to show and why, so the client never hard codes paywall logic. A paywall is shown only at a moment of value, always with the free path visible, and never with fake urgency.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /paywall/offer` | user | none | `?reason=&trip_id=&surface=` to `PaywallOffer` | Logs `paywall_viewed` (no experiment cell is shown twice in one session). Returns 200 with `offer: null` when nothing should be shown (for example when the user already has the capability). |
| `POST /paywall/events` | user | none | `{ offer_id: Uuid, event: "viewed" \| "dismissed" \| "cta_tapped" \| "purchase_started" \| "purchased" \| "purchase_failed" \| "restore_tapped" }` to 204 | Analytics and experiment accounting only. |

```ts
type PaywallOffer = {
  offer_id: Uuid; reason: PaywallHint["reason"]
  headline: string; body: string; why: string              // why this is shown now, plain words
  lead: { product_id: string; label: string; trial_days: number | null }
  alternatives: { product_id: string; label: string }[]     // at most 2
  free_path: { label: string; action: string }              // always present: "Keep planning for free"
  disclosure: string | null                                 // subscription terms line
  experiment_cell: string | null
} | null
```

Mapping (decision table the endpoint implements, detail in 07): `sharing` leads with Trip Pass for a one-trip group or Plus annual for repeat planners; `live_routes` and `agent_taster_used` lead with Plus annual; `credits` shows credit packs first for Plus and Family members and Plus for Free; `group_tools` leads with Group Trip Pass; `routines` shows Pro; `trip_limit` shows Plus and the option to archive. Credit packs are never shown beside an upsell on a trips home screen. `reason` on `GET /paywall/offer` accepts every `PaywallHint.reason` plus the client-initiated trigger codes `export_footer`, `ninth_stay`, `lifecycle_14d` and `alert_limit` ([07-monetization-spec.md](07-monetization-spec.md) section 6.2). Product ids in `lead` and `alternatives` are `store_products.product_id` values such as `wayfold_plus_annual` and `wayfold_trip_pass`.

### 5.21 Affiliate: outbound links, redirect and offers

All outbound partner links go through `/go/{click_id}`. The server mints a click id only through an authenticated call, builds the destination only from a stored `affiliate_link_templates` row plus a validated destination for that program's own hosts, and never ranks anything by commission. The server never fetches Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking.com pages; pasted listing links open unchanged and are never rewritten.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /outbound` | user (viewer on the trip) | 60 an hour per user | `OutboundIn` to 201 `OutboundLink` | Checks trip access, picks the program (feature flags, geography, A/B cell, kill switch per partner), inserts `link_clicks` with a random 128 bit base62 `click_id` (and `short_id` of 8 to 12 characters where a network limits sub-id length), returns `https://go.wayfold.app/go/<click_id>`. Repeat clicks for the same entity and surface within 30 seconds return the same link. `404 not_found` when no program applies (the client then shows the plain link). User id, trip id and email never appear in the URL. |
| `POST /shared/{token}/outbound` | none (share token) | 30 an hour per IP | `{ offer_ref: string }` to 201 `OutboundLink` | For the "Book the plan" slide on share pages. No user is attached; the click row has `user_id` null, `entity_type = 'share_link'` and the share link id as `entity_id`. |
| `GET /go/{click_id}` | none | known id; the affiliate redirect needs it fresh (under 10 minutes) and unused | none to `302 Location: <partner url>` | Sets `clicked_at`, `redirect_status`, `opened_in`, `country` and `platform` on `link_clicks`; marks the id used. Headers: `Cache-Control: no-store`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`. Never renders a page, sets a cookie or runs a script. There is no `url=` parameter; an id that never existed gets `404` with an empty body and `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`, while a known id that is expired or already used gets a 302 to the plain non-affiliate destination so nobody is stranded. Partner kill switch on: the same 302 to the plain destination. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/offers` | viewer | none | `?context=&entity_id=` to `AffiliateOffer[]` | Offers per context: `destination`, `flight_chosen`, `lodging_shortlist`, `itinerary_day`, `place`, `checklist`, `after_trip`, `presentation`. At most one card per screen view except user-requested lists. Sorting is always stated and is never by commission. Returns `[]` when the user set `hide_booking_links` (the client then renders plain links), for domestic trips on eSIM items, and before a chosen flight or booking on insurance. |
| `GET /affiliate/disclosure` | none | none | none to `{ sentence, eu_uk_label: "Ad", booking_line: string, programs: {name: string, category: string}[], ranking_rule: string }` | Static content for the "How we earn money" page. `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`. |

### 5.22 Partner guides

Labeled partner guides (curated destination guides written by or with partners, clearly marked "Partner guide"). Read only; authoring is in the admin console.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /partner-guides` | user | none | `?destination=&country=&limit&cursor` to `Page<GuideSummary>` | Sorted by recency; never by partner payment. |
| `GET /partner-guides/{slug}` | user | none | none to `Guide` | `Cache-Control: private, max-age=300`. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/items/from-guide` | editor | none | `{ guide_slug: string, entry_id: string }` to 201 `Item` | Copies a guide entry (from `partner_guides.entries`) into the itinerary pool with `source: "guide"`, attribution "From <guide>". |

```ts
type GuideSummary = { slug: string; title: string; destination_name: string; partner_name: string; cover_image_url: string | null; label: "Partner guide"; disclosure: string }   // from partner_guides, status published
type Guide = GuideSummary & { body_md: string; entries: { id: string; title: string; lat: number | null; lon: number | null; url: string | null }[]; updated_at: string }
```

### 5.23 Print orders (web)

Printed trip books are ordered on the web only (Stripe checkout; never Apple In-App Purchase because they are physical goods). iPhone clients open the web page in a browser.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /print-orders/quote` | owner or editor | none | `{ trip_id, format: "softcover" \| "hardcover", page_count: number, copies?: number, ship_to: Address }` to `PrintQuote` | Price and shipping from the print partner; valid 30 minutes. Stored as a `print_orders` row with status `draft` and `quote_expires_at` (amount, shipping and tax columns, address in `shipping_address`); `PrintQuote.id` is that row's id. |
| `POST /print-orders` | owner or editor | none | `{ quote_id: Uuid }` with `Idempotency-Key` to 201 `PrintOrder` | Moves the unexpired draft quote to `awaiting_payment` (an expired one gets `422 validation_failed` with the field error code `quote_expired`) and creates a Stripe Checkout Session; returns `checkout_url`. Status moves on Stripe webhooks. |
| `GET /print-orders` | user | none | `?limit&cursor` to `Page<PrintOrder>` | |
| `GET /print-orders/{id}` | requester | none | none to `PrintOrder` | Tracking link when shipped. |
| `POST /print-orders/{id}/cancel` | requester | status before `submitted` | `Idempotency-Key` to `PrintOrder` | Cancels and refunds through Stripe. |

```ts
type Address = { name: string; line1: string; line2?: string; city: string; region?: string; postal_code: string; country_code: string }
type PrintQuote = { id: Uuid; total: Money; items: Money; shipping: Money; tax: Money | null; expires_at: string }
type PrintOrder = { id: Uuid; trip_id: Uuid; status: "draft" | "awaiting_payment" | "paid" | "submitted" | "printing" | "shipped" | "delivered" | "cancelled" | "refunded"; total: Money; checkout_url: string | null; carrier: string | null; tracking_number: string | null; created_at: string }
```

### 5.24 Advisors (year 2, outline)

Wayfold for Advisors is a workspace product sold on the web through Stripe ($29 a seat a month, $24 annual), not through the App Store. Only outlined here; the detailed contract is written when the year 2 build starts. All routes are hidden behind the `advisor_workspaces` flag and return `404` when it is off.

| Endpoint | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /advisor-orgs` | user | Creates `advisor_orgs` and a Stripe customer. |
| `GET/PATCH /advisor-orgs/{org_id}` | org admin | Branding (logo, colors, presentation footer). |
| `POST /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/seats` | org admin | Adds or removes `advisor_seats`; quantity changes go to Stripe. |
| `GET/POST /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/clients` | seat holder | `advisor_clients`: a client is a person or a trip shared with an advisor. |
| `POST /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/clients/{client_id}/trips` | seat holder | Creates a trip owned by the advisor and shared with the client as editor or viewer; the trip uses the advisor's entitlements. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/proposals` | seat holder | Branded presentation plus a priced proposal; share link with the org's branding. |
| `GET /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/commissions` | org admin | Bookings and commission tracking entered by the advisor or imported. |

### 5.25 Admin API (outline)

Base path `/v1/admin`, hidden from the public OpenAPI schema, reachable only from the admin console origin behind Cloudflare Access, with a separate admin Supabase project claim and `admin_users.role` (`admin_role`: `owner`, `support`, `finance`, `engineer`, `content`). Every mutating call needs a `reason` string and writes `audit_log` (actor, route, target, before and after). Routes return `404` to non-admins. The route list above is a summary; the full table, limits and permissions are in [08-admin-control-center.md](08-admin-control-center.md) section 8, which is authoritative.

| Area | Endpoints (all under `/v1/admin`) | Minimum role |
|---|---|---|
| Users | `GET /users`, `GET /users/{id}`, `POST /users/{id}/sign-out`, `POST /users/{id}/ai-hold` | support |
| Billing | `GET /subscriptions`, `GET /store-transactions`, `POST /users/{id}/comp` | finance |
| Credits | `GET /users/{id}/credits`, `POST /users/{id}/credits/grant`, `POST /runs/{id}/cancel` | support |
| AI spend | `GET /ai-spend/summary`, `GET /runs` | engineer |
| Kill switches and flags | `GET/PUT /kill-switches/{key}`, `GET /flags`, `PATCH /flags/{key}` | engineer |
| Affiliate | `GET /affiliate/programs`, `PUT /affiliate/templates/{id}`, `GET /affiliate/summary`, `GET /affiliate/imports` | finance |
| Support | `GET /tickets`, `PATCH /tickets/{id}`, `GET /concierge`, `PATCH /concierge/{id}` | support |
| Content | `GET/POST/PUT /guides` | content |
| Audit | `GET /audit` | support (own actions) or owner |

## 6. Webhooks

All webhook endpoints are public routes (no bearer token), excluded from the cross-tenant test by an explicit allow-list, and served under `/v1/webhooks`. Shared processing rules:

1. Read the raw body, verify the signature with a constant-time compare before parsing. Invalid: `401 invalid_signature`, log, never process.
2. Insert into `webhook_events (provider, event_id, event_type, payload, received_at)` where `event_id` is the provider event id (Stripe `evt_...`, RevenueCat `event.id`, Apple `notificationUUID`, network `txn` key); the primary key is `(provider, event_id)`. `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. If the row already existed and `processed_at` is set (`status = 'processed'`), return `200` and stop. This is the idempotency guarantee.
3. Process in one transaction, set `status = 'processed'` and `processed_at`, return `200`. Unknown event types are stored (`status = 'ignored'`) and acknowledged with `200`. A transient failure returns `500` so the sender retries (`attempts` is incremented); a permanent failure stores `error` with `status = 'failed'` and returns `200` and alerts (payment webhook failures page the on-call).
4. Handlers are order independent: each applies the state carried in the event (and, for billing, re-reads the subscriber from RevenueCat) rather than assuming the previous event arrived.
5. Payloads are untrusted data. Amounts come from our own `store_transactions`, never from a webhook field alone.

| Endpoint | Sender | Verification | Events handled and effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /webhooks/revenuecat` | RevenueCat | `Authorization: Bearer <REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET>` compared in constant time; `environment` field must match the deployment (sandbox events are accepted only in staging) | `INITIAL_PURCHASE`, `RENEWAL`, `PRODUCT_CHANGE`, `CANCELLATION`, `UNCANCELLATION`, `BILLING_ISSUE`, `EXPIRATION`, `REFUND` (as `CANCELLATION` with reason), `NON_RENEWING_PURCHASE`, `TRANSFER`, `SUBSCRIBER_ALIAS`. Upserts `subscriptions` (unique on `store` and `original_transaction_id`) and `store_transactions` (unique on `store` and `store_transaction_id`), recomputes `entitlements`, grants the monthly credit allowance on renewal (`credit_grants.period_key` keeps it idempotent), binds Trip Pass and Group Trip Pass to the trip by inserting `trip_passes` (the purchase flow sent `trip_id` as a subscriber attribute; a pass with no trip stays `unapplied`, meaning a `store_transactions` row with no `trip_passes` row), grants credit packs keyed by the store transaction (`credit_grants.store_transaction_id` is unique), and claws back unspent credits on refund (`clawback` ledger rows; a shortfall blocks AI until later grants cover it). Family changes update household entitlements. `app_user_id` is our user UUID. Emits `subscription_started`, `subscription_renewed`, `subscription_canceled`. |
| `POST /webhooks/apple` | Apple App Store Server Notifications V2, only if used directly | Signed JWS (`signedPayload`); verify the x5c chain to Apple's root, check bundle id and environment, verify the nested `signedTransactionInfo` and `signedRenewalInfo` | `SUBSCRIBED`, `DID_RENEW`, `DID_FAIL_TO_RENEW`, `GRACE_PERIOD_EXPIRED`, `EXPIRED`, `REFUND`, `REVOKE`, `DID_CHANGE_RENEWAL_STATUS`, `CONSUMPTION_REQUEST` (answer through the App Store Server API). Runs the same entitlement code as the RevenueCat handler. Off by default while RevenueCat is the source; kept so a move to direct StoreKit needs no API change. |
| `POST /webhooks/stripe` | Stripe | `Stripe-Signature` with the endpoint secret, 5 minute tolerance | `checkout.session.completed` and `payment_intent.succeeded` (settlements, print orders), `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `charge.refunded` (print orders, settlements), `charge.dispute.created` (a settlement becomes `disputed` until Stripe resolves it), `account.updated` (sets `users.stripe_connect_ready`), `customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted` and `invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed` (advisor seats). Updates `settlements`, `payment_collections`, `print_orders`, `advisor_seats`. Stripe never grants app features for consumer digital goods. |
| `POST /webhooks/affiliate/{network}` | Travelpayouts, Impact, Stay22, Viator (where a network offers postbacks); `{network}` is an `affiliate_programs.network` value and the `webhook_events.provider` | Per network: Travelpayouts shared token in a header or query parameter plus IP allow-list; Impact HMAC signature; Stay22 and Viator by token. Reject unknown slugs with `404`. | Writes `affiliate_conversions` upserted on `(program_id, network_txn_id)`, matched to `link_clicks` by sub-id, status history (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `paid`). An unmatched conversion is stored with `click_id = null` and counted toward the unmatched-share health metric. Postbacks are a supplement: the nightly network pull job is the source of truth. Conversions never change any user-visible feature. |

Replay protection: a webhook older than 7 days is stored and ignored unless it is a refund or revocation. `webhook_events` rows are kept 12 months (03 section 8).

## 7. Mapping from the existing Trip Planner API

| Existing route (under `/api/v1`) | Wayfold route (under `/v1`) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `/trips`, `/trips/{id}` | same | UUIDv7 ids, membership scoping, `version`, `capabilities` |
| `/trips/{id}/activities`, `/activities/{id}` | `/trips/{id}/items`, `/items/{id}` | Renamed; adds `sort_order`, reorder, move, `cost` |
| `/trips/{id}/days/{day}` | same | `version` added |
| `/trips/{id}/routes`, `/routes/{id}`, `/routes/{id}/choice`, `/routes/{id}/history`, `/routes/{id}/date-grid` | same, plus `mode`, `/price-history`, alerts | `history` renamed `price-history` |
| `/trips/{id}/flights/refresh`, `/flights/best`, `/flights/summary`, `/flight-quotes/{id}` | same, `/fares/{id}` | "quote" becomes "fare"; `live-search` added |
| `/trips/{id}/lodging`, `/lodging/{id}`, `/lodging/{id}/hearts/{person_id}` | same, `/votes/me` | Hearts stay hearts (`lodging_votes`), now per user; `/lodging/preview` becomes `/lodging/parse-link` (no fetching) |
| `/trips/{id}/lodging/search-rentals` | `/trips/{id}/lodging/rental-search` | Metered, cached |
| `/people` | same | Owner scoped |
| `/places/search`, `/places/geoapify/{id}`, `/places/wiki` | `/places/search`, `/places/{id}` | Wiki folded into details |
| `/runs`, `/runs/{id}`, `/runs/{id}/events`, `/runs/{id}/outputs`, `/runs/{id}/cancel` | `/agent-runs/...` plus `/stream` | SSE added; start endpoint is new |
| `/routines` | `/trips/{id}/routines`, `/routines/{id}` | Pro only |
| `/settings` | `/me/settings` | Per user |
| `/api/auth/login`, `/session`, `/logout` | `/me/bootstrap`, `/me`, `/me/sign-out` | Passcode removed |
| `/api/agent/v1/*` | removed | The worker calls services in process |
| `/system/status`, `/system/backup`, `/usage/serpapi` | admin API | Ops only |

## 8. OpenAPI generation

FastAPI generates the OpenAPI 3.1 schema from the Pydantic 2 models and route declarations. The schema is the contract.

- `GET /v1/openapi.json` is served in development and staging only; production disables `/docs` and `/openapi.json`. The admin and webhook routers are created with `include_in_schema=False` so they never enter the public schema (the admin console has its own generated client from a second schema, `/v1/admin/openapi.json`).
- Give every route an explicit `operation_id` of the form `module_action` (`trips_create`, `flights_live_search`, `agent_runs_start`) so generated function names are stable, and a `tags` entry per module in section 5. Declare `responses={...}` with `Problem` for every documented error code so the client types include them. Mark credit-spending routes with the `x-credits: <action>` and `x-idempotency-required: true` extensions.
- `npm run gen:api` runs `uv run python -m wayfold.tools.dump_openapi > frontend/src/lib/api/openapi.json` and then `openapi-typescript openapi.json -o src/lib/api/schema.d.ts`. Commit both files. CI fails if regenerating changes the committed `schema.d.ts` (drift check), and a contract test fails if a route is missing `operation_id` or a 4xx response model.
- The web and iOS (Capacitor) clients use `openapi-fetch` on top of the generated `paths` type. `client.ts` sets `baseUrl` from `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, middleware adds `Authorization`, `X-Wayfold-Client`, `X-Client-Version` and `X-Request-Id`, adds an `Idempotency-Key` for routes marked `x-idempotency-required`, refreshes once on 401, maps `application/problem+json` to a typed `ApiError` keyed by `code`, and sends `If-Match` from the cached `ETag`.
- SSE is not described by OpenAPI. The stream route is documented with a `text/event-stream` response and the event payloads in section 5.13; the client has a small hand-written reader (`lib/api/sse.ts`) that uses the generated `RunEvent` type.
- Enums in this file are closed in the schema but clients treat unknown values as "other" (1.1).
- Backend layout: one router module per section (`api/me.py`, `api/trips.py`, `api/flights.py`, `api/lodging.py`, `api/itinerary.py`, `api/places.py`, `api/ai.py`, `api/agent_runs.py`, `api/group.py`, `api/billing.py`, `api/affiliate.py`, `api/webhooks.py`, `api/admin/`), all using the shared dependencies `CurrentUser`, `require_trip(trip_id, min_role)`, `require_gate(...)` and `idempotent(...)`.
- Tests: the cross-tenant suite (user B against user A's ids expects 404 for every route not on the public allow-list), a gate test per row of section 4, an idempotency replay test for every required route, and webhook fixtures with recorded signatures.

## 9. Example flow: trip, invite, agent run, events, credits settled

Maya (Plus, 60 credits left) plans Lisbon with Sam (Free). Headers `Authorization`, `X-Request-Id` omitted for brevity.

**1. Create the trip.**

```
POST /v1/trips
{ "name": "Lisbon in May", "start_date": "2026-05-12", "end_date": "2026-05-19", "home_currency": "USD",
  "destinations": [{ "name": "Lisbon", "country_code": "PT", "lat": 38.72, "lon": -9.14 }] }
-> 201 { "id": "0192a1f0-...-7c1", "version": 1, "my_role": "owner",
         "capabilities": { "effective_tier": "plus", "can_invite": true, "live_routes_max": 3, "max_collaborators": 6, ... } }
```

**2. Invite Sam and let him join.**

```
POST /v1/trips/0192a1f0-...-7c1/invites
{ "role": "editor", "email": "sam@example.com" }
-> 201 { "id": "0192a1f1-...", "url": "https://wayfold.app/i/Qx7...", "uses_left": 1, "expires_at": "2026-10-07T..." }

# Sam opens the link, signs in, and POST /v1/me/bootstrap creates his Free account.
GET  /v1/invites/Qx7...          -> 200 { "trip_name": "Lisbon in May", "inviter_name": "Maya", "role": "editor" }
POST /v1/invites/Qx7.../accept   { "person_id": "0192a1f2-..." }
-> 200 Trip { "my_role": "editor", "capabilities": { "effective_tier": "plus", ... } }   # trip capabilities come from Maya's tier
```

**3. Maya starts a fare hunt.**

```
POST /v1/trips/0192a1f0-...-7c1/agent-runs
Idempotency-Key: 6f1c2b7e-5d7a-4e0e-9f7a-1f7f0a8f2a11
{ "kind": "fare_hunt", "route_ids": ["0192a1f3-..."] }
-> 202 Location: /v1/agent-runs/0192a2aa-...
{ "id": "0192a2aa-...", "status": "queued", "is_taster": false,
  "credits": { "action": "agent_run", "reserved": 40, "charged": null, "from_cache": false, "balance_after": 20, "reservation_id": "0192a2a9-..." },
  "events_url": "/v1/agent-runs/0192a2aa-.../stream" }
```

A retry with the same key replays this response with `Idempotent-Replay: true`. If Sam taps "Start agent run" while Maya's runs, Sam's call succeeds only if Sam has no active run and enough of his own credits (Free: the taster, once).

**4. Receive events.**

```
GET /v1/agent-runs/0192a2aa-.../stream
Accept: text/event-stream
id: 1  event: run.started   data: {"seq":1,"summary":"Fare hunt started for LIS"}
id: 4  event: tool.search   data: {"seq":4,"tool_name":"web_search","summary":"Searching fares JFK to LIS, May 12"}
id: 9  event: fare.saved    data: {"seq":9,"summary":"Saved $489 round trip on TAP, seen on the airline page","payload":{"fare_id":"0192a2b1-..."}}
id: 17 event: run.finished  data: {"seq":17,"summary":"2 fares saved","payload":{"status":"succeeded","credits":{"reserved":40,"charged":40,"balance_after":20}}}
```

**5. Credits settled.** The worker called `settle_credits`, which marked the `ai_usage` row `settled` (provider cost $0.61, under the $0.80 hard stop) and wrote the `settle` ledger row; the run shows its receipt.

```
GET /v1/me/credits        -> 200 { "total": 20, "monthly": 20, "trip_pass": 0, "purchased": 0, "next_monthly_grant_at": "2026-10-31T..." }
GET /v1/me/credits/ledger -> 200 { "items": [{ "kind": "settle", "delta": 0, "charged": 40, "action": "agent_run", "run_id": "0192a2aa-..." },
                                               { "kind": "reserve", "delta": -40, "charged": null, "action": "agent_run", "run_id": "0192a2aa-..." }, ...] }
GET /v1/agent-runs/0192a2aa-.../outputs -> 200 { "fares": [ { "price": { "amount_minor": 48900, "currency": "USD" }, "confidence": "indicative", "source_url": "..." } ], "notes": [...] }
```

If the provider had failed before any result, the run would end `failed`, `settle_credits(reservation, 0)` would write a `refund` of +40 and a `settle` row with `charged` 0, and `run.finished` would carry `"charged": 0`. If the same run had been a shared cache hit, the receipt would show `"from_cache": true, "charged": 8`.

**6. Maya picks the fare.**

```
PUT /v1/routes/0192a1f3-.../choice   { "fare_id": "0192a2b1-..." }   -> 200 Trip (flight_dates set)
GET /v1/trips/0192a1f0-...-7c1/offers?context=flight_chosen
-> 200 [{ "category": "flight", "label": "Book on Aviasales", "price_note": "price at last check, cached 2 h ago",
          "disclosure": "We earn a commission if you book here.",
          "non_affiliate": { "label": "Search on the airline's site", "url": "https://..." } }]
POST /v1/outbound { "entity_type": "fare", "entity_id": "0192a2b1-...", "surface": "flight-chosen", "trip_id": "0192a1f0-...-7c1" }
-> 201 { "click_id": "3vQ9kT2mX0bE7nLw1ZpCya", "url": "https://go.wayfold.app/go/3vQ9kT2mX0bE7nLw1ZpCya" }
GET  /go/3vQ9kT2mX0bE7nLw1ZpCya   -> 302 Location: https://www.aviasales.com/...?marker=...&sub_id=8Kq2xPv1Lm
```

Later the nightly Travelpayouts pull (or a postback to `/v1/webhooks/affiliate/travelpayouts`) writes an `affiliate_conversions` row matched to the click by sub-id. Nothing in the app changes for the user.
