## 1. Goal and why now

**Goal.** Give a friend group, family trip or wedding party the three things group trips lack in one
place: a vote on dates, stays and activities (polls), a fair "who owes whom" ledger (manual cost
splitting, no money moves), and, on the Group Trip Pass, up to 12 travelers and a room-block request.

**Why now.**

- Persona P2 (friend-group organizer) is the viral persona: every trip brings 3 to 11 invitees who join
  free and see the product. Polls and splitting give invitees a reason to open the app daily.
- Competitive reasons. Wanderlog and Trippy both have group tools (shared planning and, for Wanderlog,
  expense splitting), so a collaborative planner without polls or costs looks incomplete to the
  friend-group buyer. Splitwise Pro (the cost-splitting anchor, $39.99 a year, reported) shows people
  will pay for splitting alone. The business plan calls group coordination "still clumsy in TripIt and
  Google Docs" ([business plan](../../01-business-plan.md)). Wayfold's edge is that polls can vote on
  real objects (a shortlisted stay, a date range) and the winner applies back to the plan.
- Revenue. The Group Trip Pass is 8 percent of payers in the pricing model at $19.99 with a 78 to 92
  percent margin ([09 revenue expansion](../../09-revenue-expansion.md) section 2.3). It is the clean
  answer to "one trip, twelve people, no subscription".
- The room-block request is a lead form routed to the host agency (see pack 07); it adds a reason to
  buy the pass for destination weddings and events.

## 2. User stories and acceptance criteria

Gating rule for the whole pack (verbatim from the full product spec): polls and manual cost splitting
(expenses, balances, "mark as paid") are included in `plus`, `family`, `pro`, `trip_pass` and
`group_trip_pass`. A `free` user uses them on any trip whose capabilities include them (for example a
trip they joined, or a trip with a pass); a `free` owner's own trip shows a preview and the paywall
moment. The Group Trip Pass adds up to 12 travelers and the room-block request. Collecting money
through Stripe (F-GRP-4, Phase 3) is for `group_trip_pass` and `pro` only. Real-world money handling
is through Stripe, never Apple In-App Purchase, and never for digital features.

### F-GRP-1 Polls

- Story: As an organizer, I want a quick vote on dates, stays or activities, so that the group
  decides without a chat thread.
- Acceptance:
  - A poll (`polls`) has a question, 2 to 12 options, single or multiple choice, optional
    deadline, and anonymous or named; votes in `poll_votes`.
  - Poll types: free text, date ranges, or pick from the trip's lodging candidates or ideas.
  - Members vote from the app or the link; results update live on refresh; owner closes the poll
    and can apply the winner (for example, marks the winning stay "Shortlisted").
  - Viewers can vote.
  - Reminder notification to members who have not voted, at most once per poll per day.
- Tier: `plus`, `family`, `pro`, `trip_pass`, `group_trip_pass`, and `free` users on trips that
  have them. A `free` owner sees polls as a preview with the `trip_pass` paywall moment. Credits:
  none.

### F-GRP-2 Expenses

- Story: As a traveler, I want to log who paid for what, so that costs stay fair.
- Acceptance:
  - An expense (`expenses`) has amount in minor units plus currency, payer, date, category,
    description, and shares (`expense_shares`) by equal split, by exact amounts, by percentages,
    or by shares; the description can name the item or stay it is for.
  - Foreign currency amounts convert to the trip currency with the ECB rate of the expense date
    and store both.
  - Editors and owners can add; every member can view their own balance.
  - Deleting an expense keeps an audit line.
- Tier: `plus`, `family`, `pro`, `trip_pass`, `group_trip_pass`, and `free` users on trips that
  have them; the traveler cap is the trip's own limit (8, or 12 on a Group Trip Pass or `pro`).
  A `free` owner sees a preview with the `trip_pass` paywall moment. Credits: none.

### F-GRP-3 Cost splitting

- Story: As a member, I want to see who owes whom in the fewest payments, so that settling is
  easy.
- Acceptance:
  - The balance screen shows each traveler's net position and a minimized set of transfers.
  - Rounding: amounts are integer minor units; leftover cents are assigned deterministically
    (by traveler order) so totals always match.
  - Travelers without accounts (`people` with no linked user) are included and shown by name.
- Tier: same as F-GRP-2.

### F-GRP-4 Settlements (manual part only in Phase 2)

- Story: As a debtor, I want to pay or record a payment, so that the trip is squared away.
- Acceptance (Phase 2 subset):
  - A settlement (`settlements`) is "Mark as paid" (manual, both sides confirm). The Stripe option
    ("Pay with card or bank through Stripe") ships in Phase 3 behind flag `group_payments`.
  - Status (`settlements.status`): pending (waiting for the payee to confirm, or for Stripe),
    recorded (confirmed manual payment), succeeded (Stripe paid), failed, refunded, disputed.
    Recorded and succeeded settlements reduce balances.
  - Payment is only for real-world trip costs; nothing digital is sold through it.
- Tier: manual marking is in every F-GRP-2 tier.
- Edge cases: a member leaves with a balance: the balance stays and the owner can write it off
  with an audit line; currency mismatch settles in the trip currency.

### F-GRP-5 Room-block request

- Story: As an organizer of a wedding or event, I want to ask for a hotel room block, so that
  guests get a group rate.
- Acceptance:
  - A form (`room_block_requests`) takes hotel (from the shortlist or typed), dates, rooms, guest
    count, budget and notes.
  - Submission is routed to the concierge team (host agency), who reply by email within 2
    business days; status is visible (submitted, in review, quoted, accepted, declined, expired, cancelled).
  - The form shows a plain disclosure: "Wayfold may earn a commission from the hotel or our host
    agency. It does not change what you pay."
  - Request creates no charge and no obligation.
- Tier: `group_trip_pass` only (a trip with a Group Trip Pass, including for its invited members).
  Credits: none.

### F-SUB-2 Group Trip Pass (the parts that differ from Trip Pass)

- Group Trip Pass: the same as Trip Pass plus up to 12 travelers, 80 credits and the room-block
  request. Trip Pass: 2 live routes, at most 60 live checks, 40 credits, up to 6 collaborators, polls
  and manual cost splitting. The passed trip does not count toward the owner's active-trip limit.
- Upgrade: buying a Group Trip Pass for a trip that has an active Trip Pass replaces it (the Trip Pass
  becomes `upgraded`, the new pass gets a full 90 days, the live-check counter carries over and
  unspent Trip Pass credits stay spendable until their own expiry).
- Guests in the group need no subscription; they join free and see polls and splits. Those who want to
  start AI actions draw from their own allowance, then the trip's pass pool.
- Expiry: if the owner's tier does not also grant them, polls and splits become read-only; past polls
  and recorded expenses remain readable and exportable. The owner sees a notice 7 days before expiry.
  A lapsed owner's trip becomes limited: extra members become viewers, live tracking pauses, polls
  close, extras are kept and come back if the owner renews.
- A pass bought while on `plus` still applies its extra group features.

### Stories added by this pack

| ID | Story | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| GRP-1 | As an organizer I apply the winning option. | `POST /polls/{id}/apply-winner` on a closed poll with one winner: a lodging option becomes `shortlisted`, a date poll sets the trip dates (only when no flight is chosen), an activity poll creates an idea. Ties are reported and nothing is applied. |
| GRP-2 | As a member I am reminded once. | Job `send_poll_reminders` (notify lane) sends at most one reminder per poll per user per day to members who have not voted, only while the poll is open and before `closes_at`; respects quiet hours and per poll mute. |
| GRP-3 | As a Free invitee I can use what the trip has. | On a trip whose merged limits include `polls` and `cost_splitting`, Free invitees create polls and expenses if their role allows (editor), vote (any role), and see their own balance. |
| GRP-4 | As a traveler without an account I am still in the ledger. | Expenses and shares reference `people`; a child or friend can owe money; the balance screen shows them by first name and color. |
| GRP-5 | As an organizer I hit a clear limit. | A ninth traveler, or the room-block request, without a Group Trip Pass shows the `group_pass` paywall; a 13th traveler is refused even with the pass (`403 limit_reached`, reason `traveler_limit`). |
| GRP-6 | As anyone I can export the ledger. | Per trip export (JSON, ICS, PDF) includes polls, expenses, shares and settlements; CSV of expenses added. Works on archived trips and after pass expiry. |

## 3. Database additions

Migration `0102_group_tools` (polls, expenses, settlements) and `0103_room_block_requests`. The
definitions are reused from [03 section 5.9 and 5.16](../03-database-schema.md). Two deliberate
differences from the full 03: `payment_collections` is not created in Phase 2 (it arrives with Stripe
collection in Phase 3), so `settlements.collection_id` is a plain nullable column with no foreign key
yet; and `room_block_requests.concierge_request_id` has no foreign key until pack 07 creates
`concierge_requests`.

Polls keep their options inside the row (`options` is an array of
`{"key": "...", "label": "...", "ref_type": null, "ref_id": null}`), because options are always read
with the poll and never joined. Expenses are kept per traveler (person), not per account, so a child or
a friend without the app can owe money.

Row-level security. The four trip-child policies (select for members, insert, update and delete for
owner and editors) apply to `polls`, `expenses`, `expense_shares`, `settlements` and
`room_block_requests` by adding them to the generated loop in 03 section 6.4. Votes have their own
shape: viewers may vote, and a vote row must be the caller's own.

```sql
ALTER TABLE poll_votes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY poll_votes_select ON poll_votes FOR SELECT USING (trip_id IN (SELECT visible_trip_ids()));
CREATE POLICY poll_votes_insert ON poll_votes FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (user_id = (SELECT app_user_id()) AND trip_id IN (SELECT visible_trip_ids()));

Balance and settle-up algorithm (application code, `apps/api/wayfold/modules/groups/balances.py`):

   recorded and succeeded settlements (a payer's settlement moves their net toward zero).
2. Split arithmetic: `equal` divides `amount_trip_minor` by the number of included people; the leftover
   minor units (at most n minus 1) go one each to the first people in traveler order
   (`trip_people.created_at`, then `person_id`). `exact` shares must sum to the amount. `percent`
   weights must sum to 100 (four decimals); `shares` uses integer weights (person-nights are entered
   as weights). The largest remainder method assigns leftovers deterministically so the sum always
   matches.
3. Minimal transfers (at most 12 travelers): find the partition of people with non zero net into the
   largest number of zero-sum groups (bitmask dynamic programming over at most 4,096 subsets); each
   group of k people needs k minus 1 transfers; inside a group match the largest debtor with the
   largest creditor, ties broken by traveler order. The output is stable across calls.
4. FX: a foreign-currency expense uses the `fx_rates` (ECB via Frankfurter) rate of the expense date
   (the last published date on or before `incurred_on`), stores `fx_rate` and `amount_trip_minor`, and
   shows the original beside the converted amount. The rate is fixed at entry.

Decision for an inconsistency in the full specs: [04 section 5.17](../04-api-spec.md) says leftover
cents go to the payer, [01 F-GRP-3](../01-product-spec.md) says deterministic by traveler order. This
pack follows the product spec (traveler order).

Edit rule for expenses: the spec says an expense is blocked once a settlement that includes it is
recorded. Because settlements are between people, not expenses, this pack defines it as: amount,
payer, currency and shares of an expense created on or before the newest `recorded` settlement on the
trip are locked (`409 state_conflict`); description, category, note and receipt stay editable.

## 4. API additions

All routes below are in [04 sections 5.17 and 5.18](../04-api-spec.md). Gate for the group tool routes:
`group_tools` (the trip's merged limits have `polls` and `cost_splitting`). Wayfold records who owes
whom; any real money moves outside the app.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/polls` | viewer | none (read allowed on any tier once created) | `?status=` to `Poll[]` | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/polls` | editor | `group_tools` | `PollIn` to 201 `Poll` | Options may reference `lodging_options`, `itinerary_items` or free text; they are stored in `polls.options` (jsonb, each with a `key`). |
| `PATCH /polls/{poll_id}` | author or owner | versioned | `{ question?, closes_at?, status?: "open" \| "closed" }` to `Poll` | Closing sets `closed_at` and `winning_option_key` (ties are reported in `winners` and the key stays null). |
| `DELETE /polls/{poll_id}` | author or owner | none | 204 | |
| `PUT /polls/{poll_id}/votes/me` | viewer | poll open | `{ option_keys: string[] }` to `Poll` | Writes `poll_votes` (`option_key`). `single` polls accept one key, `multiple` polls any number of the options. Replaces the caller's previous vote. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/expenses` | viewer | none | `?limit&cursor` to `Page<Expense>` | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/expenses` | editor | `group_tools` | `ExpenseIn` with `Idempotency-Key` to 201 `Expense` | Writes `expenses` and `expense_shares`. Shares must sum to the amount (minor units, leftover by traveler order). |
| `PATCH /expenses/{expense_id}` | author or owner | versioned | `Partial<ExpenseIn>` to `Expense` | Locked fields per the edit rule above (`409 state_conflict`). |
| `DELETE /expenses/{expense_id}` | author or owner | none | 204 | Writes an `activity_log` audit line (verb `removed`, summary with description and amount). |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/balances` | viewer | none | none to `Balances` | Net per person and the minimal suggested transfers, in the trip home currency (FX from `fx_rates`, date shown). |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/settlements` | editor | `group_tools` | `{ from_person_id, to_person_id, amount: Money, method: "manual" \| "cash" \| "bank_transfer" }` with `Idempotency-Key` to 201 `Settlement` | Records a payment. The methods start `pending` and the recipient confirms them (status `recorded`). `method: "stripe"` returns `503 feature_disabled` while flag `group_payments` is off (Phase 3). |
| `POST /settlements/{settlement_id}/confirm` | recipient | status `pending` | none to `Settlement` | Recipient confirms receipt; status becomes `recorded`. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/settlements` | viewer | none | none to `Settlement[]` | |

```ts
type PollIn = {
  question: string; subject?: "custom" | "dates" | "lodging" | "activity" | "destination"
  selection: "single" | "multiple"; is_anonymous?: boolean; closes_at?: string | null

```

Room-block routes (from 04 section 5.18):

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/room-block-requests` | owner | `room_block_request` capability (Group Trip Pass), at least 8 travelers | `RoomBlockIn` with `Idempotency-Key` to 201 `RoomBlockRequest` | Group Trip Pass feature. Writes `room_block_requests`, notifies the desk. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/room-block-requests` | viewer | none | none to `RoomBlockRequest[]` | |

```ts
type RoomBlockIn = { destination: string; check_in: string; check_out: string; rooms: number; guests: number; budget_per_room?: Money; notes?: string; hotel_name?: string; lodging_id?: Uuid }   // rooms_needed, guests_total, preferences in room_block_requests
type RoomBlockRequest = RoomBlockIn & { id: Uuid; trip_id: Uuid; status: "submitted" | "in_review" | "quoted" | "accepted" | "declined" | "expired" | "cancelled"; quote: Record<string, unknown> | null; created_at: string }
```

Additions in this pack:

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /polls/{poll_id}/apply-winner` | owner | poll closed with exactly one winner | none to `{ applied: "lodging_shortlisted" \| "dates_set" \| "idea_created" }` | Applies per GRP-1; writes an `activity_log` line; `409 state_conflict` on a tie or an open poll. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/write-off` | owner | none | `{ person_id: Uuid, reason: string }` to `Balances` | Writes off a leaving member's balance with an audit line (F-GRP-4 edge case). |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/expenses.csv` | viewer | none | CSV | Export of the ledger. |
| `PATCH /room-block-requests/{id}` | requester | status `submitted`, `in_review` or `quoted` | `{ message?: string, cancel?: boolean }` | Requester cancels or adds a message. |

Capability errors: `403 entitlement_required` with reason `group_tools` (Free owner's own trip),
`403 entitlement_required` with reason `room_block` (no Group Trip Pass), `403 limit_reached` with
reason `traveler_limit` (above 8 travelers without the pass, above 12 with it). `PaywallHint.reason`
values `group_tools`, `traveler_limit` and `room_block` already exist in the full spec. The room-block
route is also hidden and returns `503 feature_disabled` in regions where concierge is not confirmed
(seller-of-travel gate, [10 section 3.8](../10-quality-security-launch.md)).

Jobs (worker): `send_poll_reminders` (notify lane, daily at 15:00 local, key
`(poll_id, user_id, date)`), `close_due_polls` (api lane, every 5 minutes, closes polls past
`closes_at` and applies nothing), `expire_trip_passes` (existing, extended: on Group Trip Pass expiry
close open polls when the trip loses `polls`), `send_group_settle_reminders` (existing in the job
catalogue, daily at 15:00 local, only for settlements the user opted into).

Notification event types added to the F-NOT-1 matrix: poll opened, poll closed, expense added,
settlement requested, settlement confirmed, room-block update (email). Change-digest push stays at most
one per hour per trip.

## 5. UI screens and paywall triggers

Screen 6.21 "Group tools: polls, expenses, settle up" from [05](../05-ui-ux-spec.md), verbatim:

**Purpose.** Decide together and split real costs fairly. Polls and manual cost splitting are in Plus,
Family, Pro, Trip Pass and Group Trip Pass, and Free users have them on any trip that has them; the
Group Trip Pass adds up to 12 travelers and the room-block request; Stripe collection is for Group Trip
Pass and Pro and arrives in Phase 3; viewing is always allowed.
**Layout.** The Group section has a segmented control: **People, Polls, Expenses, Settle up**.
**People.** Traveler list with avatars, roles, home airports (visible to members only), "Invite" (6.8),
"Which traveler are you?" link if unclaimed. Travelers without accounts are first names with a color.
**Polls.** A poll card: question, options (stays, dates, restaurants, free text), votes as avatar chips,
a deadline, and a result line ("Alfama loft leads, 3 of 5 voted"). Create from a stay or from "New
poll". Vote is a single or multiple choice; change allowed until it closes; owner closes. A poll never
implies a purchase.
**Expenses.** List of expenses with payer, amount in mono (currency and converted trip currency), who
shares it, and category; "Add expense": title, amount, paid by, split (equally, by share, by amount, or
exclude people), date, receipt photo. Totals: "Trip total $3,480, $870 each." Offline add is queued.
**Settle up.** A plain list of "who pays whom" reduced to the fewest transfers ("Ana pays Sam $120"),
each row with "Mark as paid" (manual, available wherever cost splitting is). A payment carries the
`settlements.status` as a text chip: Waiting for confirmation (`pending`, until the person paid
confirms), Paid (`recorded`, or `succeeded` for a Stripe payment), Failed (`failed`), Refunded
(`refunded`) and In dispute (`disputed`, Phase 3); only Paid rows reduce the balances. The "Collect
payments" button (Stripe) is not built in Phase 2 and is not shown.
**States.** Loading: skeleton rows. Empty polls: "No polls yet", "Ask the group to choose between two
stays or a date.", [New poll]. Empty expenses: "No expenses yet", "Add what you pay for and we will work
out who owes whom.", [Add expense]. Error: "We could not save this expense. Check the amount and try
again." Offline: queued edits with "Waiting to sync". No permission: viewers can vote in polls and see
expenses, not add. Limit: on a trip whose owner is on Free with no pass, Polls and Expenses show a
locked preview and the `group_tools` paywall (Trip Pass or Plus; free path: view what others add, and a
free read-only balance); the room-block request and more than 8 travelers show the `group_pass` paywall
(Group Trip Pass); expense viewing stays free.
**Copy.** "Split equally among 4 people, $27.50 each." "Mark as paid" confirmation "Marked as paid. Sam
will see it." and, for the payee, "Ana says she paid you $120. Confirm?" (confirming moves the status
from `pending` to `recorded`).
**Accessibility.** Money is read with currency ("one hundred twenty US dollars"); split controls are a
labeled radio group; "who owes whom" is a list, not only a chart.

New screens and sheets in this pack:

1. **New poll** sheet: question, type (free text, dates, stays from the shortlist, ideas), options (2 to
   12), single or multiple, named or anonymous, deadline.
2. **Poll result** state with "Apply winner" (owner) and the tie message "It is a tie between Alfama
   loft and Bairro Alto flat. Pick one to apply."
3. **Room-block request** sheet (Group Trip Pass only). Fields: hotel (pick from the shortlist or type),
   dates, rooms (2 to 50), guests, budget per room, notes. Disclosure block above Submit, in body text:
   "Wayfold may earn a commission from the hotel or our host agency. It does not change what you pay."
   and "Sending this creates no charge and no obligation. A person replies by email within 2 business
   days." Status tracker: submitted, in review, quoted, accepted, declined, expired, cancelled.
4. **Trip settings, Pass** block: pass status and expiry, notice 7 days before expiry, renewal offer,
   and for a Trip Pass "Upgrade to Group Trip Pass".
5. **Limit states**: the 9th traveler sheet ("Plan for a bigger group") and the 13th traveler message
   ("A Group Trip Pass holds up to 12 travelers").

Paywall triggers (sheet from 4.14, rules in section 8 of the UI spec; free path has equal weight):

| Trigger id | When it fires | Headline | What it gives on this trip | Free path | Leading offer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `group_tools` | Free owner opens polls or expenses on a trip with no pass | "Decide together, split costs" | Polls and manual cost splitting on this trip | "View what others add" | Trip Pass (or Plus when the person has two or more active trips) |
| `group_pass` | Open the room-block request, or add a ninth traveler, without a Group Trip Pass | "Plan for a bigger group" | Up to 12 travelers, the room-block request, 80 credits | "Keep to 8 travelers" or "Skip the room block" | Group Trip Pass |
| `invite` (existing) | Free owner taps Invite | "Plan together. They join free." | Invite up to 6 people | "Share a read-only link" | Trip Pass (Group Trip Pass when the trip has 5 or more travelers) |

The decision rule `choose_offering` already returns `group` when a trigger is `group_tools` or the
trip has more than 8 travelers. No paywall appears for invitees about owning the trip, after an
affiliate booking, or during presentation playback.

## 6. Monetization and App Store products

| Product ID | Type | Price (US) | Duration | Group and level | Trial | Entitlement |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `wayfold_group_trip_pass` | Non-renewing subscription | $19.99 | 90 days | none | none | `group_trip_pass` (one trip) |

- Purchase comes first, binding second. Before purchase the app asks "Which trip is this for?"
  (pre-selected when the purchase started from a trip) and sends the trip with
  `POST /v1/purchases/sync`. A pass bought with no trip waits as "unapplied" in Settings, Purchases
  (kept 12 months) until the owner binds it with `POST /v1/me/passes/{pass_id}/bind`. Only the trip's
  owner can bind, and the purchaser must be that owner. A trip holds one active pass.
- One move: an active pass can move to another trip the same owner owns, once.
- Upgrade from Trip Pass: bind a Group Trip Pass to a trip with an active Trip Pass (see section 2).
  Nothing is refunded by Wayfold; Apple refund rules apply to each purchase. A Trip Pass cannot be
  bound to a trip that has a Group Trip Pass (`409 state_conflict`).
- Group Trip Pass limits from its `plans` row: 12 travelers (owner plus up to 11 collaborators), 80
  credits (the `trip_pass` grant with the trip id), 2 live routes and at most 60 live checks, room-block
  request. Credits follow the acting user: a guest first spends their own allowance, then the trip pool.
  Monthly provider-spend ceiling $3.60, daily $0.40.
- Refund: the pass stops granting capabilities, unspent credits are removed, the trip and data stay.
- The app never links to a web page to buy the Group Trip Pass. Every purchase is an In-App Purchase;
  nothing here uses Stripe in Phase 2.
- RevenueCat: add `wayfold_group_trip_pass` as a non-renewing product and to the `default` offering.
  Review screenshot and metadata needed; submit with an app version.

## 7. Admin additions

- **Users (08 section 6.2).** Trip passes list with status, binding, move count and upgrade chain; action
  "extend pass" (audited, existing).
- **Group payments and settlements (08 section 6.9).** In Phase 2 this screen lists manual `recorded`
  settlements read-only (as the full spec defines for launch); Stripe state, refunds and disputes arrive
  with Phase 3.
- **Concierge queue (08 section 6.8).** Room-block requests appear with kind "room block" (they come
  from `room_block_requests`); until pack 07 builds the queue, each submission emails the concierge
  desk inbox and is listed in a simple read-only Room blocks table (status, dates, rooms, age) with
  status updates by an owner-role action.
- **Overview.** Revenue by stream shows Trip Pass and Group Trip Pass separately.
- **Alert rules.** A room-block request older than 2 business days without a reply (notify).
- **Feature flags.** `group_tools` and `room_block_requests` visible; `group_payments` locked off with a
  note "Phase 3".
- **Support macros.** "How the Group Trip Pass works", "Move my pass to another trip", "Who can see the
  ledger".

## 8. AI additions

None. Polls, expenses and settlements do not use AI, and expense data, poll text and traveler names are
never sent to Anthropic (06 section 12.1: `draft_day` and `draft_trip` never send "names, notes,
expenses, other members"). A later optional idea (suggest poll options from the shortlist) would be a
`explain`-class action and is not in this pack.

## 9. Analytics events

Existing events from the full catalogue: `poll_created {option_count, subject}`, `poll_voted
{selection}`, `expense_added {split_type, member_count_bucket}`, `settle_up_viewed`,
`settlement_started {method}`, `trip_pass_applied {product, is_upgrade}`, `trip_pass_moved`,
`trip_pass_expired`, `paywall_viewed {placement}`.

| Event | Properties | When fired |
|---|---|---|
| `poll_closed` | `selection`, `vote_count_bucket`, `outcome` (`winner`, `tie`, `no_votes`), `by` (`owner`, `deadline`) | Poll closes |
| `poll_winner_applied` | `subject` | Apply winner succeeds |
| `poll_reminder_sent` | none (server side) | Reminder delivered |
| `expense_edited` | `locked_attempt` (bool) | Expense saved or blocked |
| `settlement_confirmed` | `method` | Payee confirms |
| `balance_written_off` | none | Owner writes off |
| `room_block_requested` | `rooms_bucket`, `guests_bucket`, `region` | Request submitted |
| `room_block_status_changed` | `status` (`room_block_requests.status`) | Server status change |
| `traveler_limit_reached` | `limit` (`8`, `12`) | Add traveler blocked |

## 10. Tests

- Split arithmetic property tests: for every method, random amounts and participant sets, shares always
  sum to `amount_trip_minor`; leftovers go to traveler order; balances sum to zero across a trip;
  multi-currency expenses keep both amounts.
- Minimal transfers: for random nets of up to 12 people the result zeroes all balances and never uses
  more than n minus 1 transfers; the exact partition beats or equals greedy on crafted cases; output is
  stable.
- Settlement lifecycle: `pending` until the payee confirms; only `recorded` and `succeeded` reduce
  balances; the payer cannot confirm their own payment; `stripe` method refused while the flag is off.
- Polls: single versus multiple enforcement (DB trigger and API), option key validation, closing with
  ties, apply winner per subject, deadline job, viewers can vote but not create, closed polls reject
  votes.
- Entitlements matrix: every tier and pass against `polls`, `cost_splitting` and `room_block_request`;
  Free invitee on a Plus-owned trip can use them; Free owner's own trip gets the preview and paywall;
  Plus with a Group Trip Pass takes the higher traveler limit.
- Traveler cap: 12 travelers allowed on the pass, a 13th refused, a 9th on Trip Pass shows `group_pass`.
- Upgrade: Trip Pass to Group Trip Pass keeps `live_checks_used`, old credits stay spendable, old row
  becomes `upgraded`, a second active pass on one trip refused.
- Expiry: polls close, tools become read-only, data stays exportable, notice sent 7 days before.
- Room block: entitlement, 8 traveler minimum, disclosure present in the DOM and in the email, no
  charge path exists, hidden in unconfirmed regions.
- Tenant isolation: non members cannot read or write polls, votes, expenses, shares, settlements or
  room-block requests (added to the automated cross-tenant suite).
- Offline: an expense added offline syncs once, no duplicate (idempotency key).
- E2E: create a trip with 4 people, poll two stays, apply the winner, add 3 expenses in 2 currencies,
  settle up, mark as paid and confirm.
- Sandbox purchase matrix additions: Group Trip Pass bound to a trip, upgrade from Trip Pass, bind and
  move-once, expiry, refund.

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Rounding bugs make balances not sum to zero | Integer minor units, deterministic leftovers, property tests, DB sum trigger |
| Users expect Wayfold to move money | Copy says Wayfold records who owes whom; Stripe collection is Phase 3 and never Apple IAP |
| Pass confusion (Trip Pass, Group Trip Pass, Plus) | Best-of rule stated in the paywall; upgrade path; pass status in trip settings |
| 12 travelers and AI cost on one trip | Credits follow the acting user; pass pool 80; ceilings per account |
| Room-block leads overload the founder or need licensing | Same region gate as concierge; 2 business day reply promise; capacity setting from pack 07 |
| Children or friends without accounts entered as travelers | First name and color only, no email or birthdate |
| Free invitees can write expenses on a trip that later lapses | Read only on lapse, data kept, export always works |
