# 02. Architecture

Part of the [Wayfold build specification](README.md). Shared names, tiers and the table list come from the README and win over anything here. Written 2026-09-30.

This file says how Wayfold is put together: the services, the repository, the backend modules, how a request and a job flow through the system, every configuration value, every third-party service, and what to keep from the existing Trip Planner code. The database DDL is in [03-database-schema.md](03-database-schema.md), routes in [04-api-spec.md](04-api-spec.md), AI behavior in [06-ai-agents-spec.md](06-ai-agents-spec.md), money in [07-monetization-spec.md](07-monetization-spec.md), and testing and security in [10-quality-security-launch.md](10-quality-security-launch.md).

## 1. System overview

Wayfold is one Python codebase that runs as three process types (API, worker, scheduler) from one Docker image, one PostgreSQL 18 database, and two clients (a React web app and the same app bundled into an iOS shell with Capacitor). There is no Redis at launch, no microservices, and no second database. State lives in Postgres and in Cloudflare R2 object storage. Everything else is stateless.

### 1.1 Design rules

1. The API never does slow work. Anything that calls Anthropic, loops over providers, sends push or email, builds an export or renders a PDF is a job.
2. Every job is safe to run twice. Every job has an idempotency key (section 5.1).
3. One code path per rule. Entitlement checks, credit charges, tenant checks and kill switches are each one function, called from routes and jobs alike.
4. The client never decides anything about money, limits or permissions. It displays what `GET /me/entitlements` and `TripOut.capabilities` return.
5. Postgres is the only system of record. Caches can be dropped without data loss.
6. Hosted-only code. The personal Windows mode of the old Trip Planner is not carried into Wayfold (section 14).

### 1.2 Processes

| Process | Command | Scales by | Holds state |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api` | `wayfold api` (uvicorn, 2 workers per container) | Request rate and p95 latency | None |
| `worker` | `wayfold worker --lanes api,ai,notify,batch` | Queue depth and oldest job age, per lane | None |
| `scheduler` | `wayfold scheduler` | Always 1 active (advisory lock), 2 instances for failover | None |
| `migrate` | `wayfold migrate` | One-off, pre-deploy | None |
| `admin` | Part of `api`, routes under `/admin`, separate auth | With `api` | None |

At launch the scheduler runs inside one worker process (flag `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true` on that service only). It becomes its own service when the worker is scaled past one instance.

## 2. Repository layout

One monorepo, one Git history. JS workspaces (npm) for the TypeScript packages, `uv` workspace for Python.

Rules for the tree:

- `apps/worker` imports from `apps/api` (`wayfold.modules.*`) and never the other way. Business rules live in the modules; the worker only schedules and runs them.
- `packages/shared` is the only place constants are duplicated between Python and TypeScript. A CI step (`npm run gen:shared`) generates `credits.ts`, `entitlements.ts` and `flags.ts` from Python enums, and fails on drift.
- `apps/web` has no knowledge of Capacitor except in `src/lib/native/`, which is a thin adapter that returns no-ops on the web.
- Root scripts: `npm run dev` (api, worker, web with reload), `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format`, `npm run gen:api` (OpenAPI to `apps/web/src/lib/api/schema.d.ts`, committed), `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run ios:sync`.

## 3. Backend module boundaries

Each module under `apps/api/wayfold/modules/<name>/` has the same five files: `router.py` (HTTP only), `service.py` (business rules, takes a session and a `Actor`), `repo.py` (queries), `schemas.py` (Pydantic in and out) and `models.py` (SQLAlchemy). A module may call another module's `service.py`, never its `repo.py` or `models.py`, except through the read-only `*_refs` helpers listed below. Import direction is enforced by `import-linter` in CI.

| Module | Owns (tables) | Responsibility | May call |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth` | `users`, `auth_identities`, `devices`, `consents`, `data_exports`, `deletion_requests` | JWT verification, user bootstrap on first sign-in, guest claim, devices, consent records, account deletion and export orchestration, App Attest | `notifications`, `credits` (grant on signup) |
| `trips` | `trips`, `trip_destinations`, `people`, `trip_people`, `checklist_items`, `notes` | Trip CRUD, templates, traveler profiles, checklists, trash and restore, capabilities computed per trip (`trip_capabilities()`) | `billing` (entitlements), `collaboration` |
| `collaboration` | `trip_members`, `trip_invites`, `trip_share_links`, `polls`, `poll_votes`, `activity_log` | Roles, invites, share links, polls (plus, family, pro and both passes), activity feed, optimistic concurrency helpers, ownership transfer | `trips`, `notifications` |
| `flights` | `flight_routes`, `fare_observations`, `trip_fare_links`, `chosen_flights`, `price_alerts`, `route_price_insights`, `airports`, `fx_rates` | Routes, fare ingest and dedup, cached-fare alerts, live-check scheduling inputs, chosen flight, FX conversion | `ai` (fare hunt), `credits`, `affiliate`, `providers` |
| `lodging` | `lodging_options`, `lodging_votes` | Shortlist, pasted-link previews (no Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking.com fetches), votes, compare, rental search | `places`, `affiliate`, `providers` |
| `itinerary` | `itinerary_days`, `itinerary_items` | Days and items, ordering, times and time zones, conflicts, presentation data, calendar feed (ICS) | `places`, `trips` |
| `places` | `places_cache`, `saved_places` | Geoapify search and details, Wikipedia summaries, map data, cache expiry per provider terms | `providers` |
| `ai` | `routines`, `runs`, `run_events`, `ai_usage`, `provider_calls`, `shared_research_cache` | `AgentLoop`, tool definitions, prompts, evidence rules, run lifecycle, metering, shared research cache, AI consent check, kill switches for AI | `credits`, `flights`, `trips`, `providers.anthropic` |
| `billing` | `plans`, `store_products`, `subscriptions`, `entitlements`, `trip_passes`, `store_transactions`, `webhook_events`, `households`, `household_members` | RevenueCat and Stripe webhooks, entitlement computation, Trip Pass binding, Family household, restore and reconcile | `credits` |
| `credits` | `credit_ledger`, `credit_grants`, `credit_action_prices` | The only writer of credits: grants, reserve, settle, refund, expiry, pooled Family balance, spend ceilings | none (leaf) |
| `affiliate` | `affiliate_programs`, `affiliate_link_templates`, `link_clicks`, `affiliate_conversions`, `affiliate_payouts`, `partner_guides` | Link building from stored templates, the `/go/{click_id}` redirect, disclosure flags, conversion import, revenue reports | `providers` |
| `concierge` | `concierge_requests`, `room_block_requests` | "Have a human book this" requests, advisor assignment, status, consent and disclosure, seller-of-travel gating by region | `notifications`, `advisors` |
| `groups` | `expenses`, `expense_shares`, `settlements` | Manual cost splitting and balances (every paid tier and both passes, plus Free users on trips that have them), currency handling; settle-up through Stripe only for `group_trip_pass` and `pro`, Phase 4 (never In-App Purchase) | `billing` (Stripe), `trips` |
| `notifications` | `devices` (read), notification preference and delivery rows | Push, email, digest building, preference checks, quiet hours, collapse ids, unsubscribe | `providers.apns`, `providers.resend` |
| `admin` | `admin_users`, `feature_flags`, `kill_switches`, `audit_log`, `support_tickets` | Admin console API, feature flags, kill switches, support tools, audit writes | every service (through audited functions) |
| `advisors` | `advisor_orgs`, `advisor_seats`, `advisor_clients`, `print_orders` | Advisor workspaces, client trips, proposals, seat billing on Stripe, commission tracking | `trips`, `billing`, `affiliate` |

Cross-cutting code (not modules): `security/` (owns `rate_limit_counters`), `deps.py`, `errors.py`, `logging.py`, `providers/`. The analytics helper `analytics.capture(event, props)` lives in `wayfold/analytics.py` and validates names against `packages/shared/src/events.ts`.

Boundary rules that tests enforce:

- Only `credits.service` writes `credit_ledger` and `credit_grants`. Only `billing.service` writes `entitlements`, `subscriptions`, `trip_passes` and `store_transactions`. A grep-based test fails on any other writer.
- Only `providers/*` import `httpx` or the Anthropic SDK. Modules call provider classes, which record a `provider_calls` row for every outbound call (provider, endpoint, cost units, latency, status, cached).
- Only `affiliate.service` builds outbound partner URLs. Templates come from `affiliate_link_templates`. No other module concatenates a partner URL.
- No module imports `worker`. Jobs are deferred through `jobs.enqueue(name, **args)` in `wayfold/jobs.py`, which is a thin wrapper over Procrastinate's `defer_async` that uses the caller's transaction.

## 4. Request lifecycle

### 4.1 Authenticated request

1. **Edge.** Cloudflare terminates TLS, applies WAF and per-IP rate rules, and forwards to Render. The origin accepts traffic only from Cloudflare (authenticated origin pulls). `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` makes `X-Forwarded-For` trustworthy.
2. **Middleware order.** Request id (`X-Request-Id`, generated if absent) then access log start, CORS (explicit origins, including `capacitor://localhost`), body size limit (1 MB JSON, uploads go to R2 by signed URL), kill-switch check for maintenance mode, then the route.
3. **Authentication.** Dependency `CurrentUser` reads `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` (web also accepts the `wf_session` cookie set by `POST /auth/session`). It verifies the Supabase JWT: signature against the cached JWKS (selected by `kid`, refreshed on unknown `kid` at most once per minute), `iss` equals `SUPABASE_JWT_ISSUER`, `aud` equals `SUPABASE_JWT_AUDIENCE`, `exp` and `nbf` with 30 seconds of skew. It then maps `sub` through `auth_identities` to a `users` row, creating the user and the "Me" person on first sight in one transaction. A user whose status is not `active` gets 401 (`pending_deletion` gets a specific code so the app can offer recovery).
4. **Session variable.** `DbSession` opens a transaction and runs `SELECT set_config('app.user_id', :uuid, true)` (transaction-local). Row-level security policies on trip-owned tables read `current_setting('app.user_id')`. The API database role has no `BYPASSRLS`. Jobs that act for a user set the same variable; system jobs use a separate role `wayfold_worker` with `BYPASSRLS` (see [03-database-schema.md](03-database-schema.md) section 6.1).
5. **Tenant check.** Every route with a `trip_id` depends on `require_trip(trip_id, min_role)`. It returns a `TripAccess(trip, member, role, capabilities)` object, or raises `NotFound` (404, never 403) when the user is not a member or the trip is in trash. `min_role` is one of `viewer`, `editor`, `owner`. Routes that take a child id (an itinerary item, a lodging option) resolve the child, join up to its trip and then call the same function. No route calls `session.get(Model, id)` on a tenant table. A CI test walks `app.routes` and fails if a path with an id parameter does not resolve through `require_trip` or is not on the public allowlist.
6. **Entitlement and credit checks.** Routes that cost money call `entitlements.require(capability, trip)` first (402 with a `paywall` body naming the upsell, never a bare error), then `credits.reserve(user, action, trip)` for AI actions. Both are service calls, not decorators, so the order is visible in the code.
7. **Handler and response.** The handler returns a Pydantic model. Mutations on editable rows use `If-Match` with the row version; a mismatch returns 409 with the latest row. Lists support `updated_since` and ETag for cheap polling.
8. **Errors.** One handler renders `application/problem+json`: `type`, `title`, `status`, `code` (stable string), `detail`, `request_id`. Unhandled errors return a generic 500 body and go to Sentry with the request id.
9. **Log line.** One JSON line per request: `ts`, `level`, `service`, `env`, `release`, `request_id`, `user_id` (opaque UUID), `route` (template, not raw path), `status`, `latency_ms`, `bytes`. No bodies, no query strings with tokens.

### 4.2 Public and special requests

| Route class | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health/live`, `/health/ready` | none | Ready checks database, migration head, queue reachability |
| `GET /go/{click_id}` | none | Never takes a URL from the request. Looks up a `link_clicks` row created by an authenticated call, builds the destination from `affiliate_link_templates`, logs, and 302s. Unknown or expired id goes to the trip page, never elsewhere |
| `GET /share/{token}` | token | Read-only trip view with redaction flags, per-token throttle |
| `POST /webhooks/revenuecat`, `/webhooks/stripe`, `/webhooks/resend`, `/webhooks/supabase-auth` | signature | Verify, insert into `webhook_events` by provider event id, return 200 fast, process in a job (section 5.1) |
| `POST /auth/session`, `GET /me` | JWT | Session bootstrap |
| `/admin/*` | admin session | Separate middleware: SSO, 2FA, IP allowlist optional, every call writes `audit_log` |
| `GET /i/{token}` | none | Universal link landing, JSON for the app, HTML for the web fallback |

### 4.3 Row-level security in detail

RLS is the second lock, not the first. Policies exist on: `trips`, `trip_members`, `trip_destinations`, `trip_people`, `flight_routes`, `chosen_flights`, `price_alerts`, `itinerary_days`, `itinerary_items`, `saved_places`, `lodging_options`, `lodging_votes`, `polls`, `poll_votes`, `expenses`, `expense_shares`, `settlements`, `checklist_items`, `notes`, `routines`, `runs`, `run_events`. The standard policy is `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM trip_members m WHERE m.trip_id = <table>.trip_id AND m.user_id = current_setting('app.user_id')::uuid)`. User-owned tables (`devices`, `people` by `owner_user_id`, `consents`, `credit_ledger`) use a direct `user_id = current_setting(...)` policy. A test connects as the API role with no variable set and expects zero rows from every table with a policy. DDL is in [03-database-schema.md](03-database-schema.md).

### 4.4 Web and iOS differences

| Concern | Web | iOS (Capacitor) |
|---|---|---|
| Token storage | HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Lax cookie via `POST /auth/session` | Supabase session in the Keychain through a secure-storage plugin; bearer header |
| Origin | `https://app.wayfold.app` | `capacitor://localhost` |
| CSRF | `X-Wayfold: 1` header plus `Origin` check, cookie requests only | Not applicable (bearer) |
| API base URL | `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Same, compiled into the bundle |
| Push | None at launch | APNs token registered at `POST /devices` |
| Purchases | Upgrade screen explains the app; no web checkout for digital goods | RevenueCat over StoreKit 2 |

## 5. Background jobs: how they run

Queue: Procrastinate on the application database. Four lanes (Procrastinate queues): `api` (short provider calls, 20 to 50 concurrent per worker), `ai` (Claude calls, 4 to 10 concurrent), `notify` (push and email, high concurrency), `batch` (polling and bulk work, 2 concurrent). User-visible work has a row in `runs` (status, events, cancel flag) and the job carries only `run_id`. Non-user jobs have no `runs` row; their history is Procrastinate's own job table plus a `job_heartbeats` view.

Common rules:

- **Fair claim.** Jobs carry `priority` (interactive 10, paid scheduled 5, free scheduled 1) and a per-account concurrency cap (Free 2, Plus and Family 4, Pro 8). One agent run at a time per account, enforced by a partial unique index on running agent runs.
- **Queueing locks.** A job with a `queueing_lock` collapses duplicates while one is waiting. A `lock` serializes jobs with the same key while running.
- **Reaper.** Workers heartbeat every 15 seconds. The `reap_stale_jobs` job requeues anything whose heartbeat is older than 2 minutes (5 for the `ai` lane).
- **Shutdown.** On SIGTERM a worker stops claiming, lets jobs finish up to 60 seconds (`ai` jobs checkpoint and requeue), and exits.
- **Dead letters.** A job that exhausts retries is marked `failed`, appears in the admin console, and raises an alert when the count in a lane passes 5 in an hour.
- **Retry classes.** `transient` = 429, 5xx, timeouts, connection errors: exponential backoff with jitter (base 30 seconds, factor 2, cap 15 minutes), honoring `Retry-After`. `permanent` = 4xx other than 429, validation, budget exhausted, consent missing: no retry. `none` = do not retry, the next scheduled tick covers it.

### 5.1 Job catalogue

Times are UTC unless marked local. "Key" is the idempotency key: a second run with the same key does nothing (enforced by a unique index or `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).

| Job | Lane | Trigger | Schedule | Idempotency key | Retries |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### 5.2 Scheduler design

The scheduler is a loop inside `wayfold_worker/scheduler.py`. It enqueues work; it never runs it.

1. **Leader election.** On start it tries `pg_try_advisory_lock(0x57415946)` on a dedicated connection. The holder is the leader; others sleep 10 seconds and retry. If the leader's connection drops, the lock frees and a standby takes over within 10 seconds.
2. **Routine scan.** Every 30 seconds the leader runs `SELECT id FROM routines WHERE enabled AND next_run_at <= now() ORDER BY next_run_at LIMIT 500 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. For each row it checks the kill switch for the routine's kind, checks the account's budget (reserve in the same transaction), inserts a `runs` row with `slot_at`, defers the job, and advances `next_run_at` to the next cron slot after now (never stacking missed slots). An outage of a day fires one check, not many.
3. **Jitter.** `next_run_at` = cron slot plus `hash(routine_id) mod window`, window 60 minutes for daily checks. This spreads load and is stable per routine.
4. **Periodic jobs.** Fixed-schedule jobs in section 5.1 use Procrastinate periodic tasks registered on the leader only, so they never double-fire. Each has the `slot` timestamp as its lock key.
5. **Live-route eligibility.** A route is scheduled only if the trip's best capability allows it (Plus 3, Family 5, Pro 6, Trip Pass 2 per trip, Group Trip Pass 2 per trip), the departure is within 120 days, and the trip pass has live checks left (60 max). When eligibility ends, `next_run_at` is cleared and the route keeps its last fares.
6. **Scheduled agents.** Off for everyone until Pro. Flag `scheduled_agent_routines` defaults off. The scan skips `routines.kind IN ('fare_hunt', 'deep_research')` while the flag is off.
7. **Observability.** Each tick writes `scheduler_ticks` metrics (due count, enqueued, skipped by reason, tick duration). A heartbeat URL is pinged each minute; a missing ping for 3 minutes pages.

### 5.3 Provider call flow inside a job

```
job starts -> set app.user_id (or system role) -> load run row -> check kill switch and consent
  -> cache lookup by cache_key (provider_calls / shared_research_cache / fare_observations bucket)
  -> hit: return, record provider_calls(cached=true)
  -> miss: take queueing lock on cache_key, call provider, record provider_calls(cost_units, latency, status)
  -> write results in one transaction -> settle credits and spend -> emit run_events -> enqueue notifications
```

## 6. Caching layers

There is no Redis at launch. Every layer below is in Postgres, in process memory, or at the edge.

| Layer | What | Where | Key | TTL | Invalidation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Edge static | Web build, fonts, images, brand assets | Cloudflare CDN and Pages | Content hash in file name | 1 year immutable for hashed assets, `no-cache` for `index.html` | Deploy |
| Edge API | Public GETs only: `GET /share/{token}` JSON, AASA file, partner guides | Cloudflare | URL | 60 seconds, `stale-while-revalidate` 5 minutes | Purge by tag on share link revoke |
| Client query cache | Trip data | TanStack Query, persisted to IndexedDB (SQLite in phase 2) | Query key prefixed by user id | `gcTime` 30 days, `staleTime` 30 seconds on shared trips | Sign-out clears; `updated_since` poll merges |
| JWKS | Supabase signing keys | Process memory | `kid` | 1 hour, refresh on unknown `kid` (max 1 per minute) | Key rotation |
| Feature flags and kill switches | `feature_flags`, `kill_switches` | Process memory per instance | Flag key | 15 seconds | `NOTIFY flags_changed` from admin writes refreshes at once |
| Entitlement cache | Computed tier and capabilities | `entitlements` table (`tier_code`, `limits`) plus per-request memo | `user_id` | Recomputed on each webhook and on `reconcile_entitlements` | Webhook processing |
| Fare and lodging provider results | Provider responses | `provider_calls` (`request_hash`, `cached`) plus `fare_observations` and `places_cache` | `sha256(provider, endpoint, normalized_params, time_bucket)` | Flights 6 hours, lodging and places 24 hours, FX 24 hours | Expiry sweep |
| Places | Geoapify and Wikipedia results | `places_cache` | provider id | Per provider terms (`expires_at`) | Sweep job |
| AI shared research | Public web research only | `shared_research_cache` | `(destination, month, interest_bucket, model, prompt_version)` | 7 days | Prompt version bump; admin purge |
| Anthropic prompt cache | System prompt, tool definitions, trip context prefix | Anthropic side | Prefix | 5 minutes, refreshed on use | Automatic |
| Rate limit counters | Token buckets | Postgres table `rate_limit_counters` (unlogged) | `(subject, route_class)` | Sliding window | Redis replaces at about 10k MAU |

Rules: the shared caches hold only public facts (prices, places, web research), never notes, itineraries or names. A cache hit costs the user the lower credit price where the README says so (`research` 1 credit, `agent_run` 8 credits). Cache hit rate is tracked per provider and per AI action; the target above 60 percent at 10k MAU.

## 7. Configuration

All configuration is environment variables, read once in `config.py` through `pydantic-settings`. Missing required values fail startup with a list of names (never values). Nothing outside `config.py` reads `os.environ`. `.env` is for local use only and is gitignored; `.env.example` lists every variable with a fake value and is updated in the same pull request that adds a variable.

### 7.1 Environment variables

### 7.2 Rules

- Separate values per environment. Never reuse a production key in staging, preview or CI.
- Production secrets live in Render environment groups (`wayfold-prod-shared`, `wayfold-prod-api`, `wayfold-prod-worker`). GitHub holds only deploy credentials through OIDC and the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- `config.py` exposes `settings.public_dict()` for the `GET /config` route (minimum app version, enabled feature keys), which never includes a secret field. A unit test asserts every field marked secret is excluded.
- Redaction: the log filter masks any value whose key matches `key|secret|token|password|authorization|cookie|dsn` and any JWT-shaped string.

## 8. Third-party services

| Service | Purpose | Failure behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Supabase Auth | Sign-in (Apple, Google, email code), JWT issuing | Existing sessions keep working (JWKS cached, tokens verified locally). New sign-ins fail with a friendly screen and a status link. Email code delivery goes through Resend SMTP |
| Anthropic Claude API | All AI features | Non-urgent `ai` lane pauses on repeated 429 or 5xx; users see "queued, we will finish this when the service recovers" and credits stay reserved up to 30 minutes, then release. Cached data keeps working. Kill switch `ai.all` |
| Anthropic Batch API | Cache warming | Missed night means stale research; the next night catches up |
| Render | Compute and Postgres | Multi-instance API survives one instance loss. Regional outage: status page, restore plan in the runbook |
| Cloudflare (DNS, WAF, Pages, R2) | Edge, web hosting, storage | Pages outage: the iOS app still works because it is bundled. R2 outage: uploads and exports fail with retry, trips keep working |
| RevenueCat | Purchases, entitlement events | Webhook backlog delays unlock; `POST /purchases/sync` gives instant unlock for the buyer. Outage: entitlements come from our own table, so nothing locks. Reconcile job catches up |
| Stripe | Advisor seats, group payments, print orders | Payment buttons show "temporarily unavailable"; no digital feature depends on it |
| Travelpayouts | Cached fares and affiliate network | Fare cards show last observation with its age; alerts pause; affiliate links still work |
| SerpApi | Live fares and rentals, flag `serpapi_live_fares` | Flag off or quota out: live checks fall back to cached fares and say so; credits are not charged for an empty result |
| Geoapify | Places and geocoding | Serve `places_cache`; search shows "search is limited right now"; manual place entry still works |
| Wikipedia and Wikimedia | Destination summaries and photos | Skip the summary; no error shown |
| Frankfurter | FX rates | Use the last stored `fx_rates` row, show its date |
| Viator, Stay22, other affiliate networks | Affiliate link templates, tours | Card hidden if the program's kill switch is on. Links are templates, so a provider outage only breaks the partner page |
| APNs | Push | Retry transient errors; 410 deletes the device token; the in-app feed still shows the alert |
| Resend | Email (invites, receipts, digests, auth codes) | Retry; invites can also be shared as links; if down over 30 minutes switch `EMAIL_PROVIDER` to the standby SES account (manual) |
| Sentry | Errors | Errors log locally; the app is unaffected |
| PostHog | Product analytics | Events dropped after a short local buffer; nothing user-visible |
| Better Stack | Logs, uptime, heartbeats, status page | Logs also stay in Render for 7 days |
| App Store Connect, TestFlight, Xcode Cloud | Release and review | Releases delayed; server stays backward compatible with the last 3 app versions |
| Apple App Attest / DeviceCheck | Free-credit abuse control | If unavailable, fall back to stricter IP and email limits and halve free AI for unattested devices; never block normal use |

## 9. Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Hosting | Data | Third parties |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `local` | Development | `docker compose` (Postgres 18, Mailpit, MinIO) or native Postgres; `npm run dev` | Seed data from `apps/api/wayfold/seed` and `infra/scripts/seed-staging.py` | Provider fakes by default (`PROVIDERS_MODE=fake`); Anthropic dev key with a $5 limit only when testing AI |
| `ci` | Tests | GitHub Actions with a `postgres:18` service | Ephemeral | All mocked; contract tests use recorded fixtures |
| `preview` | One per pull request | Render preview (API plus worker, small Postgres) | Seed data | Sandbox keys; separate Supabase project; APNs sandbox |
| `staging` | Release rehearsal, TestFlight backend | Render, same shape as production, smaller sizes | Synthetic, never a copy of production | Separate Anthropic workspace with a $50 monthly limit; App Store sandbox; Stripe test mode; RevenueCat sandbox |
| `production` | Users | Render plus Cloudflare | Real | Separate workspace and keys for every service |

Rules: staging and production have separate Supabase projects, R2 buckets, Sentry projects and PostHog projects. Only the image digest is promoted from staging to production; configuration is never copied automatically. The test suite and e2e seed refuse to start when `ENVIRONMENT=production` or when the database name does not end in `_test` for test runs.

## 10. CI/CD pipeline

GitHub Actions, one workflow per concern. Production deploys use OIDC, never stored cloud keys.

| Workflow | Trigger | Steps |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | Pull request | 1. Install (`uv sync --frozen`, `npm ci`). 2. `npm run lint` (ruff, import-linter, oxlint, tsc). 3. `npm test` with a `postgres:18` service (pytest and vitest). 4. OpenAPI drift: `npm run gen:api` then `git diff --exit-code` on `schema.d.ts`; shared constants drift check. 5. Tenant-isolation suite (section 1.3 of [10-quality-security-launch.md](10-quality-security-launch.md)). 6. Migration test: from empty, and from the last released revision; single Alembic head. 7. Build the Docker image. 8. Trivy scan. |
| `e2e.yml` | Pull request labeled `e2e`, nightly | Playwright against the built image with the e2e seed (desktop and iPhone viewport projects) |
| `evals.yml` | Changes under `agents/`, prompts, or model config; weekly | AI evals through the Batch API; blocks merge on a gate miss |
| `security.yml` | Weekly and on pull request | `pip-audit`, `npm audit`, `gitleaks`, CodeQL, Trivy |
| `deploy-staging.yml` | Merge to `main` | Build and push image tagged with the commit SHA, deploy staging (pre-deploy migration runs), smoke test, post result to chat |
| `deploy-prod.yml` | Manual approval on a tag | Promote the same image digest (no rebuild), snapshot Postgres if the release has a migration, pre-deploy migration, rolling deploy, post-deploy smoke test, automatic rollback if `/health/ready` fails for 2 minutes |
| `ios.yml` | Tag `ios-*` or manual | Mac runner or Xcode Cloud: `npm run build`, `cap sync ios`, archive, upload to TestFlight, upload dSYMs to Sentry |
| `dependabot.yml` | Continuous | Weekly grouped updates |

Branching: trunk based. Short-lived branches, squash merge, `main` is always deployable. Every merge to `main` deploys staging automatically. A production release is a tag `vYYYY.MM.DD.N`.

## 11. Docker image

One multi-stage `infra/docker/Dockerfile`:

1. `node:22-slim` stage: `npm ci`, build `apps/web` (used only for the optional self-host image and e2e; production web ships from Cloudflare Pages).
2. `python:3.13-slim` builder stage: install `uv`, `uv sync --frozen --no-dev` for `apps/api` and `apps/worker` into `/app/.venv`.
3. Final `python:3.13-slim` stage, pinned by digest: copies the venv and source, creates a non-root user `wayfold` (uid 10001), read-only root filesystem compatible (writes only to `/tmp`), no compilers, `HEALTHCHECK` on `/health/live`.
4. Entry point `wayfold`; the platform sets the command: `api`, `worker --lanes ...`, `scheduler`, `migrate`.

The image contains no secrets and no `.env`. Build arguments are limited to `RELEASE_SHA`. Trivy fails the build on fixable high or critical findings.

## 12. Migrations as pre-deploy

- Alembic. Migrations run as a Render pre-deploy command (`wayfold migrate`) using `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`. New instances take traffic only after it succeeds. The command takes `pg_advisory_lock(0x4d494752)` so two deploys cannot race.
- Expand and contract. Release N adds nullable columns and new tables; release N+1 writes both and backfills in a batched job; release N+2 drops the old column. Old and new code must both work against the schema during a rolling deploy.
- Safety: `lock_timeout = 5s`, `statement_timeout = 60s` for DDL, `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` for large tables, no data backfills inside Alembic.
- Rollback means rolling forward with a fix, or a point-in-time restore. Down migrations exist for development only. A manual Render Postgres snapshot is taken before any release that contains a migration touching more than a trivial table.
- CI fails on multiple heads, on a migration that has no corresponding model change, and when `alembic upgrade head` followed by `alembic check` reports drift.
- Seed data (airports, `affiliate_programs`, default `feature_flags`) loads through idempotent `wayfold seed`, run after migrate in the same pre-deploy command.

## 13. Feature flags and kill switches

Both live in Postgres (`feature_flags`, `kill_switches`), are cached 15 seconds per process, and change instantly through `NOTIFY`. Only admins change them, through the admin console, and each change writes `audit_log`. A flag may target a percentage, a tier, a user list or an app version range. Clients read the enabled set from `GET /config`; the server always re-checks.

**Feature flags** (release control, default in parentheses)

| Key | Controls |
|---|---|
| `scheduled_agent_routines` (off) | Pro scheduled agent routines |
| `tier_pro` (off) | Pro products visible and purchasable |
| `serpapi_live_fares` (off until terms audit passes) | Live fare and rental provider |
| `concierge_requests` (off until seller-of-travel registration is confirmed per region) | Concierge requests |
| `group_payments` (off; Phase 4) | Stripe collection for `group_trip_pass` and `pro` |
| `advisor_workspaces` (off) | Advisor seats and workspaces |
| `inapp_hotel_booking` (off) | LiteAPI booking, later |
| `room_block_requests` (on) | Room-block request on Group Trip Pass trips |
| `print_orders` (off) | Printed trip books |
| `poll_comments` (off) | Comments and mentions |
| `shared_research_cache` (on) | Shared research cache reads and writes |
| `min_app_version` (value) | Forces update below a version |

**Kill switches** (operational control, default off; turning one on disables the thing)

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ai.all` | Pauses the `ai` lane; AI buttons show "AI is paused, your plans are safe" |
| `ai.agent_runs` | Blocks `agent_run` only |
| `ai.free_tier` | Blocks AI for Free accounts |
| `ai.web_search` | Runs without server web search and fetch tools |
| `ai.force_haiku` | Uses the fast model for every feature that allows it |
| `provider.<name>` | Disables one provider (`serpapi`, `travelpayouts`, `geoapify`, `viator`, `stay22`, `frankfurter`) |
| `affiliate.<program_code>` | Hides one program's cards and stops new clicks for it |
| `push.all`, `email.all` | Stops sending |
| `signups` | Stops new account creation (existing users unaffected) |
| `webhooks.process` | Keeps receiving webhooks but pauses processing, for a safe replay |
| `maintenance` | Read-only mode: writes return 503 with a friendly body |

Practice every switch in staging each quarter. Anthropic workspace spend limits are the backstop outside our code.

## 14. Mapping the existing Trip Planner code

Paths are under `backend/tripplanner/` and `frontend/src/` in the current repo. Reuse means copy with small changes; adapt means keep the idea and rewrite for multi-tenant and Wayfold names; drop means do not carry over.

### 14.1 Backend

### 14.2 Frontend and tooling

| Existing | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend/src/index.css` passport tokens | Reuse | Becomes `packages/tokens`; Wayfold uses the same passport theme |
| `components/brand/*` (guilloche, logo, brand mark) | Adapt | Swap the logo for the Wayfold mark from `brand/`; geometry and tests stay |

| `lib/dates.ts`, `money.ts`, `currencies.ts`, `format.ts`, `timezones.ts`, `geo.ts`, `itinerary-time.ts`, `trip-status.ts`, `price-sources.ts` and their tests | Reuse | Pure logic; money moves to integer minor units where not already |
| `lib/theme*.ts*`, `hooks.ts`, `utils.ts`, `errors.ts` | Reuse / Adapt | Hooks namespace the query cache by user |
| `routes/settings-page.tsx`, `setup-checklist.tsx`, `routes/lodging-import.tsx` | Adapt | Settings becomes account, devices, consent, export, delete; setup checklist becomes onboarding; the bookmarklet stays user-initiated and never server fetched |
| `routes/errors.tsx`, `trips-home.tsx`, `routes/trip/*` | Adapt | Add empty, offline, paywall and out-of-credits states |
| `frontend/e2e`, `playwright.config.ts` | Adapt | Move to `apps/web/e2e`; Chromium and WebKit projects, iPhone viewport |

| `scripts/setup.mjs` | Adapt | Becomes `npm run setup` that starts compose, migrates and seeds |
| Root `package.json` scripts | Adapt | Keep `dev`, `test`, `lint`, `format`, `gen:api`, `test:e2e`; drop `autostart:*`, `share`, `backup`, `restore`, `agent:smoke` |
| `.claude/rules/*`, `knowledge/` | Adapt | Keep the three-tier context layout and the migrations and frontend rules for the new repo; rewrite the agent rules for the API loop |

| `CLAUDE.md` rule "never fetch Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking pages" | Reuse | Becomes product rule 3 in the README |

### 14.3 One-off data import

A script `infra/scripts/import_trip_planner.py` reads the personal Trip Planner database and creates two `users`, their `trip_members` (owner), `people` with `linked_user_id`, trips, flights, itinerary, lodging and notes with new UUIDs, using the new schema. It is run once, by hand, against staging first. It is not part of the product.
