# Phase 1: the launch app (months 1 to 6)

Part of the [Wayfold build specification](../README.md). Written 2026-09-30.

Phase 1 is a complete, polished Wayfold that a solo developer working with Claude Code can build in
about six months and publish to the App Store (and the web). It earns money from day one:
subscriptions, trip passes, credit packs and affiliate links. Everything else waits for
[Phase 2](../phase-2-growth/README.md) or [Phase 3](../phase-3-scale/README.md).

## Scope

### In Phase 1

| Area | What ships |
|---|---|
| Accounts | Sign in with Apple, Google and email code (Supabase Auth); guest mode that is claimed on sign-up; onboarding with "Coming from TripIt or Wanderlog?"; profile, settings, data export, in-app account deletion |
| Switching | Import a trip from a calendar file or calendar feed (TripIt single-trip export or iCal feed, Google Calendar) and from pasted booking confirmations (Haiku extracts flights, stays and reservations); first import earns a free Trip Pass for that trip |
| Trips | Trips, destinations, travelers (`people`), dates, currency, archive, duplicate |
| Collaboration | Roles (owner, editor, viewer), invite links, share links; Free owners invite 1 collaborator per trip, Plus and Trip Pass up to 6; hearts on stays and places; activity log |
| Flights | Routes, cached fares (Travelpayouts), live fares behind a provider interface (SerpApi behind a flag), price history, chosen flight, price alerts, and the booked-fare drop alert ("you paid $X, it is now $Y; check the airline's change and credit rules") |
| Stays | Shortlist, pasted links (never fetched for Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking.com), hearts, compare, rental search (behind the SerpApi flag), "Book via partner" |
| Plan | Day-by-day itinerary, drag and drop, places search and details (Geoapify, Wikipedia), map, ideas list |
| Evidence | Notes with sources; every AI-found fact shows "Found on [site], checked [date]" |
| Present | Full-screen presentation mode, shareable read-only link, PDF export (Free adds a small footer) |
| Before you go | Checklist with official visa and entry links first, then labeled partner items (eSIM, insurance referral, transfers, bookings) |
| AI | `explain`, `draft_day`, `draft_trip`, `research`, `agent_run` (manual fare hunt and deep research), the one-time taster, packing list, booking import; shared research cache; credits and ceilings |
| Offline | Trips readable offline on every tier; edits queue and sync |
| Calendar | Live calendar subscription feed per trip |
| Notifications | Push (APNs) and email for price drops, invites, run results, pre-trip reminders |
| Money | Free, Plus (monthly and annual, 7-day trial on annual), Trip Pass, credit packs via RevenueCat; paywalls; affiliate links through `/go/{click_id}` with Travelpayouts, Stay22 and Viator; nightly conversion import |
| Admin | Overview dashboard, users, subscriptions and store transactions, credits and AI spend, kill switches, feature flags, affiliate revenue, support inbox, provider and system health, audit log, basic content reports |
| Platforms | Web app and iOS app (Capacitor, bundled). Android users get the web app until Phase 2. |
| Growth basics | Public sample trips and shared-trip pages for search, honest comparison pages (`/vs/...`), referral credits, App Store listing |

### Added from the competitive analysis

These come from [../../competitive-analysis/win-plan.md](../../competitive-analysis/win-plan.md)
section 9 and are part of Phase 1:

| Feature | Effort | Beats |
|---|---|---|
| "Verify this plan": paste an itinerary from ChatGPT, Gemini, Layla or Mindtrip; Wayfold checks each place, opening hours and price with sources and marks what it could not confirm (`research` credits per checked item, capped per run) | M | Every AI planner |
| Imports named for each rival: TripIt, Tripsy and Wanderlog entries on the import screen, and Google Maps saved-list import (pasted list link or exported file; never scraped) | S to M | TripIt, Tripsy, Wanderlog |
| Evidence freshness: a "may be out of date" flag after 14 days and a one-tap recheck | S | AI planners |
| Trust pages: "How we earn" (every affiliate partner and that nothing is ranked by commission), a plain billing page, and a one-tap cancel link in the app | S | Wanderlog, Layla, Tripsy |
| Public status page and a "Synced N seconds ago" indicator | S | Wanderlog, Tripsy |
| Android web-app install guide and testing on Android Chrome | S | Tripsy, TripIt Pro |

Early Phase 2 (first items after launch): "paste your group chat" to draft a plan (answers Trippy),
and repair-a-day when plans change. Email-forward import is decided at the month 4 review based on
how pasted imports perform in the beta.

### Settled values (all Phase 1 files use these)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Referral credits | 20 credits to each person after the new user's first trip with dates; expire after 12 months; referrer caps 5 per rolling 30 days and 10 per calendar year; referral credits do not raise the spend ceiling |
| Booked-fare drop alert | Fires when the current fare is at least 5% and at least $10 (converted) below what the user paid; at most once per flight every 7 days; never includes a partner link |
| First-import Trip Pass | Once per user; the import must add at least 3 items including a flight or a stay; verified email; the trip has no active pass and the user has no active Plus |
| Calendar feed imports | Opt-in "Keep checking this calendar"; polled every 6 hours; changes are shown as a preview the user confirms, never applied automatically |
| Web purchases | None in Phase 1: the web paywall says "Upgrade in the iOS app". Web billing arrives with Android in Phase 2. |
| Free collaborators | 1 per trip; share links (read-only, with the "Made with Wayfold" footer) on every tier |

### Not in Phase 1

| 4 | Money: RevenueCat, Plus, Trip Pass, packs, paywalls, affiliate redirect and reporting, checklist; imports; admin essentials | Sandbox purchases work end to end; clicks and conversions tracked |
