# 03. Database schema (Phase 1: launch)

Part of the [Phase 1 build specification](README.md) of [Wayfold](../README.md). The shared decisions in the [build README](../README.md) override anything here. This file is the complete, self-contained Phase 1 schema: every table, type, function, index, row-level security policy, grant, retention rule and seed row that the Phase 1 features need, and nothing that only a later phase uses. Section 14 lists what Phase 2 and Phase 3 add on top.

Target: PostgreSQL 18 (native `uuidv7()`), SQLAlchemy 2 models, Alembic migrations, Render managed Postgres with point-in-time recovery. Every `sql` block below is written to run as-is on a fresh database, top to bottom, in the order given: a table is always created before the tables that reference it. Blocks that show example queries, or statements with `:parameters`, are fenced as `postgresql` so that a runner that loads the `sql` blocks never executes them. The blocks were loaded in order into a throwaway PostgreSQL 16 cluster (with `uuidv7()` shimmed by `gen_random_uuid()`) and a short isolation smoke test ran as `wayfold_app`; the only PostgreSQL 18 dependency is the native `uuidv7()`. The blocks were loaded the same way again after the last integration pass (35 blocks, zero errors), and a short smoke test checked the functions and constraints that pass added: the import reward conditions, `set_import_polling()`, the referral caps (5 per rolling 30 days, 10 per calendar year), `bootstrap_user()` setting `email_verified_at`, and the plan verification evidence check and grants.

## 1. Scope and how to read this file

- Section 1 states what Phase 1 keeps, drops and adds. Section 2 sets the conventions every table follows. Section 3 is the shared setup (extensions, domains, helper functions).
- Section 4 is the entity-relationship overview in four diagrams. Section 5 is the complete DDL in dependency order.
- Sections 6 to 12 cover row-level security, key queries, retention, partitioning, the Alembic order, seed data and the mapping from the existing Trip Planner tables.
- Section 13 lists every table added beyond the build README list, with the reason. Section 14 is "What later phases add".
- The DDL is the source of truth for names and types. SQLAlchemy models mirror it one to one (same table, column and constraint names; the naming convention in section 2 keeps Alembic stable).
- Plan numbers (limits, prices, credits, ceilings) come from the build README and from `../../02-pricing-tiers.md`. They live in seed rows (section 11), never in code constants, so a price test needs no migration.

### 1.1 What Phase 1 keeps, drops and adds

**Dropped (Phase 2 or 3 only).** These tables from the full schema do not exist in Phase 1: `households`, `household_members`, `polls`, `poll_votes`, `expenses`, `expense_shares`, `settlements`, `payment_collections`, `room_block_requests`, `concierge_requests`, `partner_guides`, `print_orders`, `advisor_orgs`, `advisor_seats`, `advisor_clients`, and also `routines` (scheduled agent routines are Pro, Phase 2; Phase 1 agent runs are manual, and the daily live-route checks are a worker job driven by `flight_routes`, not a routine).

**Dropped columns and values.** `users.stripe_connect_account_id` and `stripe_connect_ready`; `credit_grants.household_id`, `subscriptions.household_id`, `entitlements.household_id`; `trip_passes.upgraded_from_id`; `runs.routine_id` and `runs.priority`; the enum values `household_monthly` (credit grant kind), `upgraded` (pass status), the routine and scheduled run kinds; the `consents.kind` value `concierge_sharing`; the `itinerary_items.source` value `guide`; the direct-program affiliate networks; and the plan limit keys for polls, cost splitting, room blocks, group payments, scheduled routines, priority queue, credit rollover and household size.

**Seed rows decision.** The `plans` rows for `family`, `group_trip_pass`, `pro` and `advisor_seat` are not seeded at all, not even as inactive rows. No Phase 1 logic reads them: `store_products`, `subscriptions`, `entitlements` and `trip_passes` are constrained to Phase 1 plan codes, the entitlement merge (7.1) works on whatever rows exist, and the legacy import comps the owner accounts to Plus. Phase 2 inserts them with its own migration. Likewise the direct affiliate programs (Expedia Group and Vrbo, Booking.com direct, Skyscanner, Airalo, GetYourGuide direct, AirHelp), the Travelpayouts compensation program (used only by the Phase 2 after-trip prompt), and the feature flags and kill switches of later features are not seeded.

**Changed to match the Phase 1 scope.** The Free plan invites 1 collaborator per trip (`collaborators = 1`, `can_invite = true`), as the build README says, where the full schema had 0. `store_transactions.kind` is `subscription`, `pass` or `credit_pack`. Phase 1 has no web purchases (the web paywall says "Upgrade in the iOS app"), so `store_products.store`, `store_transactions.store` and `subscriptions.store` allow only `apple`, `store_products` has no web price column, and `webhook_events.provider` has no web billing value; Phase 2 adds them together with web billing.

**Added for Phase 1.** `trip_imports` (calendar file, calendar feed, pasted booking confirmation, Google Maps export and pasted places imports, the rival entry the user came through, parsed counts, opt-in calendar feed polling columns, and the once-per-user free Trip Pass reward) with `grant_import_reward()` and `set_import_polling()`; `plan_verifications` and `plan_verification_items` ("Verify this plan" results with the evidence for each checked item, 5.20); evidence freshness columns `notes.checked_at`, `itinerary_items.check_url` and `itinerary_items.checked_at`; `users.email_verified_at` (a condition of the import reward); booked-fare columns on `chosen_flights` and the `booked_fare_drops` view for the booked-fare drop alert; `referral_codes` and `referral_rewards` with the referral functions; `saved_place_votes` (hearts on places); `notifications` (push and email outbox with de-duplication); `sample_trips` (public sample trips); `fx_convert_minor()`; `trip_passes.source`; `itinerary_items` and `lodging_options` import columns. Section 13 gives the reason for each.

## 2. Conventions

1. **Identifiers.** Every row that a client can see has `id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuidv7()`. UUIDv7 is time-ordered (good index locality) and not guessable. There are no sequential ids in URLs or API payloads. High-volume internal log tables (`run_events`, `provider_calls`, `ai_usage`, `credit_ledger`, `fare_observations`, `audit_log`, `activity_log`) use `bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` and are never exposed by id to clients.
2. **Timestamps.** Every timestamp is `timestamptz` and stored in UTC. Mutable tables have `created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()` and `updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()`, kept current by the `set_updated_at()` trigger. Append-only tables have only `created_at`. Wall-clock values that belong to a place (an itinerary item at 19:30 in Lisbon) are `date` and `time` columns without a zone; the zone comes from the destination.
3. **Money.** Amounts of real money are `bigint` minor units plus an ISO 4217 code: `price_minor bigint`, `currency currency_code`. The exponent comes from `currency_exponent(code)` (2 for USD and EUR, 0 for JPY, 3 for KWD). Never use `numeric` or `float` for money. FX conversion is done at read time with `fx_rates` (`fx_convert_minor()`); a converted amount is never stored, because a fare or price is a display value with a timestamp, not an agreement. The amount a user actually paid is stored in the currency they paid (`chosen_flights.paid_minor`).
4. **Provider spend.** Our own cost is `bigint` micro-dollars (`_micros` suffix, 1,000,000 = $1). One credit is 20,000 micro-dollars. Never mix micro-dollars and minor units in one column.
5. **Enums.** Closed sets that the API exposes and that rarely change are Postgres enums (`CREATE TYPE`). Sets that grow with partners, providers or features use `text` with a named `CHECK` constraint, so adding a value is a cheap constraint swap instead of `ALTER TYPE`. Adding an enum value uses `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` in its own migration step (it cannot be used in the same transaction that adds it).
6. **Nullability.** Columns are `NOT NULL` unless null carries a meaning (for example `end_time`, `deleted_at`). Booleans are `NOT NULL DEFAULT false` or `true`. Empty text defaults to `''`, never null, where the UI treats empty and missing the same.
7. **Soft delete.** Only two things are soft deleted, because the product promises a recovery window: `users` (`deleted_at`, status `pending_deletion` then `deleted`, 30 day grace) and `trips` (`deleted_at`, 30 days in trash). Everything else is hard deleted. Partial indexes filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` so live queries never see trash. Hard purge jobs are in section 8.
8. **Foreign keys.** Trip children use `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `trip_id`. Attribution columns (`created_by`, `updated_by`, `author_user_id`) use `ON DELETE SET NULL`, which the UI renders as "Former member". Financial records (`store_transactions`, `credit_ledger`, `ai_usage`, `subscriptions`, `affiliate_conversions`) use `SET NULL` on `user_id` so a deleted account keeps an anonymous record for the tax retention period. `trips.owner_user_id` is `RESTRICT`: the deletion job must transfer or delete a user's trips first. A record that must outlive its trip (`trip_imports`, which carries the once-per-user reward flag) uses `SET NULL` on `trip_id`. Partitioned log tables (`run_events`, `provider_calls`, `link_clicks`) carry no foreign keys to users or trips and nothing references them (a partitioned table can only be referenced together with its partition key); `run_events` keeps its cascade foreign key to `runs` and `link_clicks` references `affiliate_programs`. The deletion job scrubs them by `user_id`.
9. **Constraint and index names.** Follow the existing Trip Planner naming convention in `backend/tripplanner/models/base.py`: `pk_<table>`, `uq_<table>_<col>`, `fk_<table>_<col>_<referred>`, `ck_<table>_<name>`, `ix_<table>_<cols>`. The DDL below uses short explicit names that match.
10. **Trip consistency.** A child table that has its own `trip_id` and also points at a row that belongs to a trip (for example `lodging_votes` points at `lodging_options`) uses a composite foreign key `(parent_id, trip_id)` so a child can never point at a parent in another trip. Parents carry `UNIQUE (id, trip_id)` for this. The `trip_id` copy also makes row-level security policies cheap (section 6).
11. **Optimistic concurrency.** Rows that two people edit (`trips`, `itinerary_days`, `itinerary_items`, `flight_routes`, `lodging_options`, `checklist_items`, `notes`) carry `version integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1`. The API updates with `WHERE id = :id AND version = :v` and returns 409 with the latest row when zero rows change. The `bump_version()` trigger increments it, and the API returns the value as the strong `ETag` and in the `version` field (04 section 1.7).
12. **JSONB.** Used for provider payloads, plan limits, flag rules and other shapes that are read whole and never joined. Anything filtered, sorted or constrained is a real column. Provider payloads (`raw`) are short-lived (section 8) because storing them long term is a terms risk.
13. **Tenancy.** The tenant is the user account; trips are shared by membership in `trip_members`. Global tables have no tenant column and are read-only to the app role.
14. **Text hygiene.** Emails are `citext`. Codes are uppercase `char(3)` or `char(2)` through the domains in section 3. Free text has length checks where the UI has a limit. No table stores passwords, passport numbers, payment card data or advertising identifiers.

## 3. Shared setup

Run first (migration `0001`). The `wayfold_owner` role owns all objects and runs migrations; the other roles are described in section 6.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;

-- Domains keep codes consistent across tables.
CREATE DOMAIN currency_code AS char(3) CHECK (VALUE ~ '^[A-Z]{3}$');
CREATE DOMAIN iata_code     AS char(3) CHECK (VALUE ~ '^[A-Z]{3}$');
CREATE DOMAIN country_code2 AS char(2) CHECK (VALUE ~ '^[A-Z]{2}$');
CREATE DOMAIN hex_color     AS char(7) CHECK (VALUE ~ '^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$');

-- Keeps updated_at current. Attach with add_updated_at_trigger('table') in each migration.
CREATE FUNCTION set_updated_at() RETURNS trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN NEW.updated_at := now(); RETURN NEW; END $$;

CREATE FUNCTION add_updated_at_trigger(p_table regclass) RETURNS void LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
  EXECUTE format(
    'CREATE TRIGGER trg_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON %s FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION set_updated_at()',
    p_table);
END $$;

-- Optimistic concurrency counter.
CREATE FUNCTION bump_version() RETURNS trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN NEW.version := OLD.version + 1; RETURN NEW; END $$;

CREATE FUNCTION add_version_trigger(p_table regclass) RETURNS void LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
  EXECUTE format(
    'CREATE TRIGGER trg_version BEFORE UPDATE ON %s FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION bump_version()',
    p_table);
END $$;

-- Minor-unit exponent for ISO 4217 (2 unless listed).
CREATE FUNCTION currency_exponent(c text) RETURNS smallint LANGUAGE sql IMMUTABLE AS $$
  SELECT CASE
    WHEN c IN ('BIF','CLP','DJF','GNF','ISK','JPY','KMF','KRW','PYG','RWF','UGX','UYI','VND','VUV','XAF','XOF','XPF') THEN 0
    WHEN c IN ('BHD','IQD','JOD','KWD','LYD','OMR','TND') THEN 3
    ELSE 2 END
$$;

-- Session user for row-level security (section 6). NULL when unset, so policies fail closed.
CREATE FUNCTION app_user_id() RETURNS uuid LANGUAGE sql STABLE AS $$
  SELECT nullif(current_setting('app.user_id', true), '')::uuid
$$;
```

## 4. Entity-relationship overview

Four diagrams, split by domain. Only keys and the columns that explain a relationship are shown; the DDL in section 5 is complete. Crow's foot notation: `||--o{` is one to many.

## 5. Tables (DDL)

Grouped by domain and listed in creation order: every table is created before the tables that reference it, so the blocks run top to bottom (the migration revisions in section 10 follow the same order). Each `CREATE TABLE` is followed by its indexes. Triggers for `updated_at` and `version` are attached with the helpers from section 3.

### 5.1 Identity and devices

`users` is our account row. Supabase Auth only proves who someone is; `auth_identities` maps its subject to our `users.id`, so switching vendor is a remap of that one table.

```sql
CREATE TYPE user_status AS ENUM ('active', 'suspended', 'pending_deletion', 'deleted');

CREATE TABLE users (
  id                  uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuidv7(),

### 5.2 Reference data

Global tables with no tenant column. The app role has `SELECT` only; the worker role writes them. They come early because later tables and views use `fx_convert_minor()`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE airports (                                          -- seeded from OurAirports (public domain)

  name          text NOT NULL,
  city          text,

### 5.3 Plan catalog (seed-driven)

Three small catalog tables hold what the build README calls tiers and credit prices, so a price or limit test is an `UPDATE`, not a deploy. Values are in section 11. The client never decides; the API reads `entitlements` and these tables. `ai_action` is created here because `credit_action_prices` and later tables use it.

```sql

### 5.4 Trips and collaboration

`trips.id` is the public UUIDv7. Sharing is membership with a per-trip role. Exactly one `owner` member exists per trip and it always equals `trips.owner_user_id` (the trigger below creates it; ownership transfer is one function call in one transaction).

```sql
CREATE TYPE trip_status AS ENUM ('planning', 'booked', 'done', 'archived');

### 5.5 People

A person is a traveler on a trip even if they never sign in (a child, a friend). `owner_user_id` is the account that manages the row; `linked_user_id` is set when the traveler is a real account. Every new user gets a "Me" person (`is_self = true`).

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (
  id               uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuidv7(),
  owner_user_id    uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  linked_user_id   uuid REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE SET NULL,

  created_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (trip_id, person_id)
);
CREATE INDEX ix_trip_people_person ON trip_people (person_id);
```

Rule enforced by the API: a person is linked to at most one user per trip, and a linked person's name and airports are shown only to co-members of that trip.

### 5.6 AI: runs, events, usage, provider calls and shared research

A `run` is one execution: a manual research question, a draft, a booking import, a plan verification or evidence recheck, or an agent run (fare hunt or deep research). The account that pays is `runs.user_id` (charged credits). `run_events` and `provider_calls` are high-volume logs and are partitioned by month (section 9). `ai_usage` is the billing-grade record; `runs.cost_usd_micros` is the operational copy. Phase 1 has no scheduled runs: there is no `routines` table, every run is started by a person (or by the import job on a person's behalf), and the daily live-route fare checks are worker jobs that write `fare_observations` and `provider_calls` without a run. The `ai_action` enum was created in 5.3.

```sql
CREATE TYPE run_kind     AS ENUM ('fare_hunt', 'deep_research', 'research_question', 'draft_trip', 'draft_day', 'explain',

Rules for `shared_research_cache`: the key is built only from normalized public inputs (destination, month, prompt version, model), never from user text, and entries are never derived from private notes or trip data. A hit costs the user 1 credit instead of 8 (research) or 8 instead of 40 (agent run). The refresh lease that keeps 50 simultaneous requests to one model run is a session-level `pg_try_advisory_lock(hashtextextended(key, 0))`, so it needs no column and dies with the worker. A "Report a problem" sets `expires_at` and `stale_until` to now (the entry is no longer served and is purged); the third report from a different user also sets `flagged_at`, which pauses that key (no serve, no rewrite, no purge) until an admin reviews it. `kind` is the storage class (`destination_brief` for briefs, `ai_research` for the other research topics, `agent_result` for fare hunts and deep research, `place_check` for the public facts found about one place when a plan is verified: hours, ticket price and source, kept 14 days); the topic (`destination_brief`, `events_and_closures`, `reservations_needed`, `getting_around`, `seasonal_notes`, `fare_hunt`) is `params ->> 'topic'`.

### 5.7 Billing: subscriptions, entitlements, passes, transactions, webhooks

Apple is the source of truth for purchases; RevenueCat webhooks (over StoreKit 2) feed these tables, which are a read model. The backend reads `entitlements` and `trip_passes` only and never calls Apple on a request. Phase 1 sells Plus (monthly and annual), the Trip Pass and three credit packs; the `store` and `kind` checks below list only what Phase 1 uses (Phase 2 adds `google`, web billing and the Family and Group Trip Pass values; Phase 3 adds the Stripe-only kinds).

### 5.8 Credits

One credit is a budget of up to $0.02 of provider spend (20,000 micro-dollars). `credit_grants` holds spendable balances (and is the only mutable part); `credit_ledger` is an append-only record of every movement, with reserve, settle and refund entries. Spend order: monthly allowance first, then promo (taster and referral credits), then Trip Pass credits for that trip, then purchased packs (oldest expiry first inside a class). Monthly allowances never roll over. Purchased credits last 12 months.

### 5.9 Trip imports and referrals

**Imports.** A `trip_imports` row records one import a user ran. `source` is the input method: a calendar file (`ics_file`, for example a TripIt, Tripsy or Google Calendar export), a calendar feed URL (`ics_feed`), pasted booking confirmations (`pasted_text`, extracted by Claude Haiku in a `booking_import` run), a Google Maps saved-list export file (`maps_file`: Takeout CSV, GeoJSON or KML, read locally) or pasted place names (`places_text`, for example a list copied out of Wanderlog or a Google Maps list). `origin` is the entry the person used on the import screen (`tripit`, `tripsy`, `wanderlog`, `google_calendar`, `google_maps` or `other`); it only changes the instructions the screen shows and feeds the "switch imports per week" metric, never the parsing. The file or text is parsed into a preview (`preview`, kept 7 days), the user confirms, and the job writes `itinerary_items` (flights, reservations and place ideas, with `source = 'import'`) and `lodging_options` (stays, `added_via = 'import'`) that point back to the import through `import_id`, so one tap can undo an import. The raw upload lives in R2 (`raw_key`, deleted after 7 days); pasted text is never stored. Stays in a confirmation are read from the text the user pasted, never fetched from the booking site. Nothing in a Google Maps file or pasted list is ever fetched: a place is matched by name through place search, and any Google Maps URL in the file stays as text in the item's notes. A pasted Google Maps list link is never opened (Google's terms); the screen explains how to export the list and keeps the link only as a note on the trip.

**Keep checking this calendar.** A feed import can be switched to polling, by the person and only after the first preview is confirmed (`set_import_polling()`). Polling needs the feed URL, which often carries a secret token, so for a polled feed (and only then) the URL is kept encrypted in `feed_url_enc` (application-level AES-GCM, key in the `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable (02 section 7), never logged). For an import that is not polled the URL is held only until the preview is confirmed or discarded and is then set to NULL by the worker. A worker job reads every row whose `next_poll_at` is due (every 6 hours), fetches the feed through the same SSRF guard as the first read, and compares a hash of the feed body with `last_content_hash`. No change: only `last_polled_at` and `next_poll_at` move. A change: the worker builds a diff against the items this import created (matched by `import_uid`) and stores it in `pending_changes` with a `calendar_changes` notification. The diff is a preview and nothing is applied until the person confirms it; it is never applied automatically. A fetch failure adds one to `consecutive_failures` (reset on success); the third failure in a row switches polling off, deletes the URL and sends a `calendar_poll_stopped` notification. Polling also stops 7 days after the trip's end date. A person can have at most 3 polled feeds.

**The free Trip Pass reward.** The first qualifying import a user applies earns a Trip Pass (90 days, 40 credits) on the imported trip. An import qualifies when it adds at least 3 items including a flight or a stay (`items_applied >= 3` and `flights_applied + stays_applied >= 1`), the importer has a verified email (`users.email_verified_at`), the trip has no active pass and the importer has no active Plus. Place-only imports (Google Maps and pasted places) and calendar poll updates never qualify. "Once per user" is enforced by the partial unique index `uq_trip_imports_one_reward` and by `grant_import_reward()`: the reward flag lives on the import row, which survives deletion of the trip (`trip_id` is `SET NULL`), so deleting the trip and importing again never grants a second pass. Users cannot delete import rows (6.1). An import that does not qualify returns `NULL` and does not consume the reward, so it stays available for the next import. The pass is an ordinary `trip_passes` row with `source = 'import_reward'`, and its credits are a `trip_pass` grant for that trip.

**Referrals.** Every user can have one referral code (`referral_codes`, created on first use by `my_referral_code()`). A new user who enters a code within 14 days of sign-up creates one `referral_rewards` row through `redeem_referral()`; a user can be referred once (`uq_referral_rewards_referee`). The worker marks the row `qualified` when the referee creates their first trip with dates (`trips.start_date` set; read from `feature_flags` key `setting_referral_credits`), then `grant_referral_reward()` gives 20 credits to each person as `promo` grants that expire after 12 months, with `period_key = 'referral:' || id`, which makes the grant idempotent. The referee always gets their 20. The referrer gets theirs until they reach 5 rewards in a rolling 30 days or 10 in a calendar year (UTC); a capped row is still marked `granted` for the referee and records `referrer_capped`. Credit amounts, the qualifying rule, the expiry and both caps come from that setting, not from code. Referral credits are promo credits: they never raise the provider-spend ceiling (06 6.5), and they are credits only: never cash, never a tier.

### 5.10 Affiliate: programs, link templates, clicks, conversions

All outbound partner links go through `/go/{click_id}`. The redirect target is built only from a stored template plus a validated destination on the program's own hosts: there is no `url=` parameter and no open redirect. The per-click sub-id is random and carries no user id, trip id, email or device id; the join from conversion to click to user and trip happens only here. Airbnb has no program and can never be added (check constraint). Pasted listing links are never rewritten. Phase 1 networks are Travelpayouts, Stay22 and Viator; the direct programs (Impact, Booking.com and others) arrive in Phase 2, which widens the `network` check.

### 5.11 Flights and fares

`fare_observations` is shared across all users: one row per observed fare, keyed by route, dates and search. A user's route links to observations through `trip_fare_links`, so 1,000 users watching the same route cost one live call per cache window. Observations are display hints with a source and a timestamp ("price seen at 14:05 from Travelpayouts"), never a bookable guarantee.

`chosen_flights` is the flight picked for a route. Phase 1 adds the booked-fare fields to it: when the user marks the flight booked they can enter what they paid (`paid_minor`, `paid_currency`, `booked_at`, `booked_by`). The booked-fare drop alert compares that amount with the latest matching observation for the same route, dates and cabin (view `booked_fare_drops`, below) and tells `booked_by`: "you paid $X, it is now $Y; check the airline's change and credit rules". Wayfold never claims a refund is owed and never books anything.

The booked-fare drop alert reads this view nightly (worker role). It returns one row per booked flight that has a matching observation from the last 48 hours priced below what the user paid, already converted to the currency they paid in. The worker then applies the thresholds in `feature_flags` key `setting_booked_fare_drop` (`min_drop_pct`, `min_drop_usd`), skips rows whose `current_minor` is not lower than `last_drop_notified_minor` and flights already alerted in the last 7 days (`min_days_between`), and writes a `notifications` row with `dedupe_key = 'booked_drop:<chosen_flight_id>:<current_minor>'`. A missing FX rate makes `fx_convert_minor()` return `NULL` and the row is skipped: no made-up number is ever shown. Cached fares are display hints: the message always says where and when the price was seen.

### 5.12 Alerts

Free gets one alert on cached fares; paid tiers get live-fare alerts and more routes (limits come from `entitlements.limits`, enforced by the API). Push is sent to the user's non-revoked `devices`. The booked-fare drop alert is separate: it lives on `chosen_flights` (5.11), does not count against `price_alerts`, and uses cached fares for Free and live fares where the tier allows them.

```sql
CREATE TABLE price_alerts (

### 5.13 Itinerary and places

Day rows exist only once something is set (the days themselves come from the trip dates). `saved_places` is the trip's shortlist of places; dragging one onto a day creates an `itinerary_items` row that keeps a copy of the place fields so the item survives cache expiry. Items written by a trip import carry `import_id` (undo) and `import_uid` (the calendar event UID or a hash of the parsed booking, so importing the same file twice does not duplicate anything).

```sql

### 5.14 Lodging and hearts

The server never fetches Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking.com pages. Rows for those hosts hold only what the user typed or pasted (`added_via` is `paste` or `bookmarklet`), or what a booking confirmation the user pasted or imported says (`import`), and pasted URLs are stored exactly as pasted. Photos are hotlinked or held as thumbnails with a source link. A heart is one row per traveler: `lodging_votes` for stays and `saved_place_votes` for places. `user_id` attributes it to an account.

```sql

### 5.15 Checklist and notes

`checklist_items` stores the "Before you go" state per trip: one row per kind from the checklist rules (`source = 'rules'`), any number of custom items (`kind = 'custom'`, `source = 'user'`) and the lines of an accepted AI packing list (`kind = 'packing'`, `source = 'ai'`, one row per line). Official visa and entry links come first; at least half of the kinds are unmonetized; only kinds linked to a partner create `link_clicks`. `notes` holds both user notes and agent findings, and can be attached to a day or an itinerary item; an agent note must carry at least one source URL. `notes.checked_at` is the date on the evidence label: it is the day the agent saw the fact on its source page, and a one-tap recheck (06 5.12) moves it forward.

```sql
CREATE TABLE checklist_items (
  id             uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuidv7(),

### 5.16 Admin

The admin console (`08-admin-control-center.md`) runs as the `wayfold_admin` database role. `admin_users` and `audit_log` are not readable by the app role (the API may only insert audit rows), `feature_flags` and `kill_switches` are read-only to it, and `support_tickets` and `content_reports` are limited to the caller's own rows by the policies in 6.4. Every admin write also writes `audit_log`.

### 5.17 Privacy and request plumbing

`consents` is an append-only event log: the current state is the latest row per user and kind. `deletion_requests` keeps no foreign key to `users`, because the job outlives the user row and must survive its hard purge. `rate_limit_counters` and `idempotency_keys` are request plumbing that also lives here.

### 5.18 Notifications

Push (APNs) and email for price drops, booked-fare drops, invites, run results, import results, calendar changes found by polling, finished plan checks, pre-trip reminders and referral rewards. A row is created by the job that has the news and carries a `dedupe_key`, so a retried job or a repeated scan never sends the same message twice. The sender honors the user's consents (`push_notifications`, `marketing_email` does not apply to transactional mail), the `push.all` and `email.all` kill switches and each device's `revoked_at`. The row is also the in-app inbox entry (`read_at`).

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id             uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuidv7(),
  user_id        uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

### 5.19 Public sample trips

Public sample trips and shared-trip pages are search entry points. A sample is an ordinary trip owned by a Wayfold staff account, published through this table with a slug and search copy. The public page is served by a server route that reads through the worker role and applies the same redaction rules as `trip_share_links` (no addresses, prices or traveler names); it is not a share link, never expires and carries no view counter. The app role reads published rows only (policy in 6.4) and cannot write the table. Comparison pages (`/vs/...`) are static web content and need no tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sample_trips (
  id                 uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuidv7(),
  slug               text NOT NULL CHECK (slug ~ '^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$'),

### 5.20 Plan verification ("Verify this plan")

A person pastes an itinerary written by ChatGPT, Gemini, Layla, Mindtrip or anything else, and Wayfold checks each place, its opening hours and its price against place data and cited pages (06 5.11). Two runs are involved: `verify_extract` reads the text into a list of items (Haiku, 1 credit) and `verify_plan` checks the items the person selected (1 credit per checked item, capped per run). The pasted text is never stored: only the extracted items, the claims in them and the evidence found are kept, for 30 days, so the result can be reopened and imported. One `plan_verifications` row belongs to one trip (the trip the person ran it from; the trip counts toward active trips like any other). Items that are not checked stay `unchecked` with a reason. Every `green` or `amber` item carries the source page and the day it was seen, which is the evidence label; `red` means nothing could be found. Airbnb, Vrbo and Booking.com pages are never opened: a stay on those sites can only be `unchecked` with reason `blocked_source` unless place data recognizes it. Importing the result writes `itinerary_items` with `source = 'verify_plan'`, `check_url` and `checked_at` (so the freshness flag and recheck apply), and stamps `imported_item_id` on the item.

```sql
CREATE TABLE plan_verifications (

The API writes a verification row when a person starts one and may change only `status` (to `discarded`) on it; every other column, and every item column except `selected` and `include_in_import`, is written by the worker, so a member cannot edit a verdict or an evidence date (6.1).

## 6. Row-level security

Row-level security (RLS) is the second layer. The first layer is the API dependency `require_trip(trip_id, min_role)`, which returns 404 (never 403) for non-members. RLS turns a forgotten `WHERE` clause into an empty result instead of a cross-tenant leak.

### 6.1 Roles and privileges

All objects are owned by `wayfold_owner`, which runs the migrations. On the managed database it already exists as the migration login; the first statement below only makes a fresh scratch database (CI, a laptop) work the same way.

```sql
DO $$ BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'wayfold_owner') THEN CREATE ROLE wayfold_owner NOLOGIN; END IF;
END $$;

-- wayfold_owner owns every object and runs migrations. It is never used by the API or worker.
CREATE ROLE wayfold_app    NOLOGIN NOBYPASSRLS;   -- the API: subject to every policy
CREATE ROLE wayfold_worker NOLOGIN BYPASSRLS;     -- Procrastinate workers, scheduler, webhooks, import jobs
CREATE ROLE wayfold_admin  NOLOGIN BYPASSRLS;     -- the admin console only (the "admin bypass" role)
-- Login roles carry the secrets from environment variables (never in the repo), for example:

`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is deliberately not used: `wayfold_owner` owns the tables and the `SECURITY DEFINER` helpers below read across tenants on its behalf, while `wayfold_app` never owns a table, so it can never bypass a policy. The test suite must therefore connect as `wayfold_app` (section 6.5).

### 6.2 The session setting and helper functions

Every API transaction starts with `SELECT set_config('app.user_id', '<uuid>', true)` (the same as `SET LOCAL app.user_id = '<uuid>'`, but it accepts a bound parameter; transaction scoped, so it is safe with PgBouncer transaction pooling). When the setting is missing, `app_user_id()` returns null and every policy evaluates to false, so the request sees nothing.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION visible_trip_ids() RETURNS SETOF uuid
LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public AS $$
  SELECT trip_id FROM trip_members WHERE user_id = app_user_id()
$$;

CREATE FUNCTION can_edit_trip(p_trip uuid) RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM trip_members
                  WHERE trip_id = p_trip AND user_id = app_user_id() AND role IN ('owner', 'editor'))
$$;

CREATE FUNCTION is_trip_owner(p_trip uuid) RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM trip_members WHERE trip_id = p_trip AND user_id = app_user_id() AND role = 'owner')
$$;

-- Co-members see each other's display name only, never email. This view runs with the owner's rights.
CREATE VIEW trip_member_profiles AS
SELECT tm.trip_id, tm.user_id, tm.role, u.display_name
  FROM trip_members tm JOIN users u ON u.id = tm.user_id
 WHERE tm.trip_id IN (SELECT visible_trip_ids());
GRANT SELECT ON trip_member_profiles TO wayfold_app;

-- Editors cannot hand a trip to someone else; ownership moves only through transfer_trip_owner() (not shown: one transaction
-- that swaps trip_members roles and trips.owner_user_id, running as wayfold_owner).
CREATE FUNCTION trips_guard_owner() RETURNS trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.owner_user_id <> OLD.owner_user_id AND pg_has_role(current_user, 'wayfold_app', 'member') THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'owner_change_forbidden' USING ERRCODE = '42501';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END $$;
CREATE TRIGGER trg_trips_guard_owner BEFORE UPDATE OF owner_user_id ON trips
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION trips_guard_owner();
```

Performance: policies call `visible_trip_ids()` as an uncorrelated subquery, which Postgres evaluates once per statement as an initial plan and answers from the `(user_id, trip_id)` index on `trip_members`. A member has tens of trips, so the set is small. Policies that compare a column to `app_user_id()` are written as `(SELECT app_user_id())` in hot paths to force the same caching.

### 6.3 Example policies: trips, trip_members and a child table

```sql
-- trips: members read; owner deletes; anyone may create a trip they own; editors update (owner change is blocked by trg_trips_guard_owner).
ALTER TABLE trips ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY trips_select ON trips FOR SELECT
  USING ((id IN (SELECT visible_trip_ids()) AND deleted_at IS NULL) OR owner_user_id = (SELECT app_user_id()));   -- trash stays visible to its owner
CREATE POLICY trips_insert ON trips FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (owner_user_id = (SELECT app_user_id()));
CREATE POLICY trips_update ON trips FOR UPDATE USING (can_edit_trip(id)) WITH CHECK (can_edit_trip(id));
CREATE POLICY trips_delete ON trips FOR DELETE USING (is_trip_owner(id));

-- trip_members: co-members read the roster; only the owner adds or changes roles; anyone can remove themselves (leave).
-- Invite redemption inserts the row through a SECURITY DEFINER function (redeem_trip_invite), not through this policy.
ALTER TABLE trip_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY trip_members_select ON trip_members FOR SELECT USING (trip_id IN (SELECT visible_trip_ids()));
CREATE POLICY trip_members_insert ON trip_members FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (is_trip_owner(trip_id));
CREATE POLICY trip_members_update ON trip_members FOR UPDATE USING (is_trip_owner(trip_id)) WITH CHECK (is_trip_owner(trip_id));
CREATE POLICY trip_members_delete ON trip_members FOR DELETE
  USING (is_trip_owner(trip_id) OR (user_id = (SELECT app_user_id()) AND role <> 'owner'));

-- A trip child table (itinerary_items): every member reads, owner and editors write. Viewers cannot edit.
ALTER TABLE itinerary_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY itinerary_items_select ON itinerary_items FOR SELECT USING (trip_id IN (SELECT visible_trip_ids()));
CREATE POLICY itinerary_items_insert ON itinerary_items FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (can_edit_trip(trip_id));
CREATE POLICY itinerary_items_update ON itinerary_items FOR UPDATE USING (can_edit_trip(trip_id)) WITH CHECK (can_edit_trip(trip_id));
CREATE POLICY itinerary_items_delete ON itinerary_items FOR DELETE USING (can_edit_trip(trip_id));
```

### 6.4 Policies for every other tenant table

Most trip children have the same four policies. A loop generates them so a new table cannot be forgotten (the test in 6.5 fails if a table with a `trip_id` column has RLS disabled).

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE t text;
BEGIN
  FOREACH t IN ARRAY ARRAY[
    'trip_invites', 'trip_share_links', 'trip_destinations', 'trip_people', 'flight_routes', 'trip_fare_links',
    'chosen_flights', 'itinerary_days', 'saved_places', 'lodging_options', 'checklist_items', 'runs',
    'plan_verifications', 'plan_verification_items'
  ] LOOP
    EXECUTE format('ALTER TABLE %I ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY', t);
    EXECUTE format('CREATE POLICY %I ON %I FOR SELECT USING (trip_id IN (SELECT visible_trip_ids()))', t || '_select', t);
    EXECUTE format('CREATE POLICY %I ON %I FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (can_edit_trip(trip_id))', t || '_insert', t);
    EXECUTE format('CREATE POLICY %I ON %I FOR UPDATE USING (can_edit_trip(trip_id)) WITH CHECK (can_edit_trip(trip_id))', t || '_update', t);
    EXECUTE format('CREATE POLICY %I ON %I FOR DELETE USING (can_edit_trip(trip_id))', t || '_delete', t);
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

CREATE POLICY users_update ON users FOR UPDATE USING (id = (SELECT app_user_id())) WITH CHECK (id = (SELECT app_user_id()));

Affiliate, catalog and admin tables have no policies: they are covered by the grants in 6.1.

### 6.5 The admin bypass role and tests

- `wayfold_admin` and `wayfold_worker` have `BYPASSRLS`. The admin console connects as `wayfold_admin`, sets `app.admin_user_id` for the session, and writes one `audit_log` row per action (actor, action, before, after, reason). The worker must set `app.user_id` explicitly (or use trip and user ids it was given) when it writes on behalf of a user, so its logs stay attributable.
- Global tables are readable by the app role and never writable (6.1).
- **Tests run as the restricted role.** `pytest` connects as `wayfold_api_login` (today's test suite runs as the owner, which silently bypasses RLS). A generated test walks `information_schema` and fails if any table in `public` has a `trip_id` or `user_id` column and `relrowsecurity` is false and the table is not on a short allowlist (`run_events` partitions inherit from the parent; `admin_users`, `deletion_requests` and `affiliate_conversions` are closed to the app role by grants; `provider_calls` is insert-only; `link_clicks` is stamped by the `/go` redirect before any user context exists). A second generated test creates tenants A and B and asserts, for every tenant table, that B sees zero of A's rows and cannot insert, update or delete them. Extra tests cover the Phase 1 functions: `grant_import_reward()` grants once per user and again never (including after the trip is deleted), `redeem_referral()` refuses your own code and a second redemption, and `grant_referral_reward()` is idempotent.

## 7. Key queries

These are reference queries the API and jobs depend on. They use `:named` parameters, so they are fenced as `postgresql` and are not part of the top-to-bottom run.

### 7.1 Effective entitlement for a trip

A trip's capabilities are the best of its owner's tier and any active pass on that trip, evaluated per limit (a number takes the larger value, a flag is true if any source grants it). Invitees are evaluated against the trip, never their own tier, for trip features. The result is cached in the API for the request. Flags are written so that `true` is always the better value (for example `hide_presentation_footer`), which is what lets one generic merge work for every key.

```postgresql
WITH owner_tier AS (
  SELECT t.id AS trip_id, pl.code, pl.limits
    FROM trips t
    LEFT JOIN entitlements e ON e.user_id = t.owner_user_id AND (e.valid_until IS NULL OR e.valid_until > now())
    JOIN plans pl ON pl.code = COALESCE(e.tier_code, 'free')
   WHERE t.id = :trip_id AND t.deleted_at IS NULL
), pass AS (
  SELECT tp.trip_id, pl.code,
         pl.limits || jsonb_build_object(
           'live_routes', tp.live_routes_max,
           'live_checks_max', tp.live_checks_max,
           'collaborators', tp.collaborators_max,
           'travelers_per_trip', tp.travelers_max) AS limits
    FROM trip_passes tp JOIN plans pl ON pl.code = tp.plan_code
   WHERE tp.trip_id = :trip_id AND tp.status = 'active' AND now() >= tp.starts_at AND now() < tp.expires_at
), candidates AS (
  SELECT 'tier' AS source, code, limits FROM owner_tier
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'pass', code, limits FROM pass
)
SELECT
  (SELECT array_agg(source || ':' || code ORDER BY source) FROM candidates) AS sources,
  jsonb_object_agg(m.key, m.merged) AS limits
FROM (
  SELECT l.key,
         CASE WHEN bool_and(jsonb_typeof(l.value) = 'number')
              THEN to_jsonb(max(CASE WHEN jsonb_typeof(l.value) = 'number' THEN (l.value #>> '{}')::numeric END))
              ELSE to_jsonb(bool_or(CASE WHEN jsonb_typeof(l.value) = 'boolean' THEN (l.value #>> '{}')::boolean END)) END AS merged
    FROM candidates c, jsonb_each(c.limits) AS l
   GROUP BY l.key
) m;
```

The owner-tier limit `credits_*` and the ceilings are not used for trip features; credits and ceilings belong to the acting user (7.2 and 7.4). When the owner's tier lapses or the pass expires, the query simply returns the Free limits: data is never deleted, and members beyond the collaborator limit are treated as viewers by the API.

### 7.2 Credit balance

```postgresql

### 7.3 Reserve credits atomically

The API reserves before it starts any paid work, settles when the work finishes, and releases on failure. One statement does the whole reserve; concurrent actions serialize on the grant rows, and two parallel requests can never overspend.

```postgresql
BEGIN;
SELECT set_config('app.user_id', :user_id, true);
-- 1. Insert the usage row (unique idempotency key: a retry cannot double charge).
INSERT INTO ai_usage (user_id, trip_id, run_id, action, credits_reserved, idempotency_key)
VALUES (:user_id, :trip_id, :run_id, :action, :price, :idem)
ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) DO NOTHING
RETURNING id;                                              -- no row back = replay: load the existing usage row instead
-- 2. Reserve. Raises WF402 (insufficient credits) and rolls back the statement.
SELECT reserve_credits(:user_id, :trip_id, :price, :action, :run_id, :idem) AS reservation_id;
UPDATE ai_usage SET reservation_id = :reservation_id WHERE id = :usage_id;
COMMIT;

-- When the work finishes (a separate transaction; the charged amount may be lower than the reserve):
SELECT settle_credits(:reservation_id, :credits_charged, :usage_id);
UPDATE ai_usage SET cost_usd_micros = :cost, input_tokens = :in_tok, output_tokens = :out_tok,
                    cache_hit = :cache_hit, model = :model WHERE id = :usage_id;
-- On failure, timeout or an empty result: settle_credits(:reservation_id, 0, :usage_id) returns everything.
-- release_stale_reservations() does the same for crashed workers.
```

The price comes from `credit_action_prices` (`credits_cached` when the shared cache answers). A user stopping an agent run is charged pro rata by turns used with a minimum of 8 credits: the worker computes `:credits_charged` and calls `settle_credits`.

### 7.4 Provider-spend ceilings (monthly and daily)

Checked before the credit reserve because it is the harder limit. Cached data keeps working when a ceiling is hit, and a credit balance never overrides a ceiling. The ceilings come from the merged limits (`monthly_ceiling_micros`, `daily_ceiling_micros`). An agent run is admitted when the month has at least the action's `hard_stop_micros` (800,000) of headroom, even if that exceeds the daily budget.

```postgresql
WITH bounds AS (
  SELECT (date_trunc('month', now() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') AS month_start,
         (date_trunc('day',   now() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') AS day_start
), spend AS (
  SELECT created_at, cost_usd_micros FROM ai_usage, bounds
   WHERE user_id = :user_id AND state <> 'released' AND created_at >= bounds.month_start
  UNION ALL
  SELECT created_at, cost_usd_micros FROM provider_calls, bounds
   WHERE user_id = :user_id AND provider <> 'anthropic' AND cost_usd_micros IS NOT NULL
     AND created_at >= bounds.month_start
)
SELECT COALESCE(sum(cost_usd_micros), 0)                                                     AS month_micros,
       COALESCE(sum(cost_usd_micros) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= (SELECT day_start FROM bounds)), 0) AS day_micros
  FROM spend;
```

Reading `provider_calls` from the API role needs a `SECURITY DEFINER` wrapper (`my_provider_spend_micros(since timestamptz)`) because the app role cannot select that table (6.1). Pass-funded work is measured against the pass ceiling for that trip using `ai_usage.trip_id`. Purchased packs raise the monthly ceiling by the cost value of credits spent from them (`credits * 20000`), since that spend is separately paid.

## 8. Retention rules

The product promises account deletion in the app, data export on every tier, and no data held hostage on downgrade. Retention jobs run nightly in the worker role. Backups (point-in-time recovery plus a daily logical dump to R2) age out within 35 days, which the privacy policy states.

| Table | Retention | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `users`, `auth_identities`, `devices`, `consents` | While the account exists. Hard purge 30 days after a deletion request | Deletion job (section 8.1). Revoked `devices` rows purged 90 days after `revoked_at` |
| `trips` and all trip children (`trip_*`, `flight_routes`, `chosen_flights`, `price_alerts`, `itinerary_*`, `saved_places`, `saved_place_votes`, `lodging_*`, `checklist_items`, `notes`, `plan_verifications`, `sample_trips`) | While the trip exists. Trash for 30 days, then hard delete (cascades) | `DELETE FROM trips WHERE deleted_at < now() - interval '30 days'` |
| `trip_invites` | Expire at 7 days, rows purged at 30 days | `DELETE ... WHERE expires_at < now() - interval '30 days'` |
| `trip_share_links` | Until revoked or expired (default 90 days); purged 30 days after | Nightly delete |
| `activity_log` | 90 days | Nightly delete by `created_at` |
| `trip_imports` | The uploaded file (`raw_key`) is deleted from R2 and `preview` is nulled 7 days after creation. The feed URL (`feed_url_enc`) is deleted when polling is switched off, when the import is discarded, after 7 days if it was never applied, and when the trip is deleted. `pending_changes` is nulled 30 days after it was created if nobody confirmed it. The row (counts, status, reward flag) stays with the account, because the reward flag must outlive the trip; it is deleted with the account | Nightly job; cascade on user delete |
| `plan_verifications`, `plan_verification_items` | 30 days after creation (`expires_at`), or with the trip. The pasted text itself is never stored | Nightly `DELETE FROM plan_verifications WHERE expires_at < now()` (items cascade) |
| `fare_observations` | `raw` nulled after 14 days; rows kept 24 months for price history | Nightly `UPDATE ... SET raw = NULL`, then batched `DELETE` (5,000 rows per batch) past 24 months |
| `trip_fare_links` | With the trip; links to pruned observations cascade away | Foreign key cascade |
| `chosen_flights.paid_minor` | With the trip. The user can clear it; it is never sent to AI or shared links | Foreign key cascade |
| `route_price_insights` | 7 days after `expires_at` | Nightly delete |
| `lodging_options.raw` | 30 days, then nulled | Nightly update |
| `runs` | `prompt` nulled after 30 days; `report` kept 12 months; row kept 25 months | Nightly update, then delete |
| `run_events` | 30 days in the product; partitions older than the previous month are dropped, so at most about 62 days exist | Partition drop plus a nightly delete inside the oldest kept partition (section 9) |
| `ai_usage` | 25 months | Batched delete by `created_at` |
| `provider_calls` | 13 months, then monthly rollups | Partition drop after rollup (section 9) |
| `shared_research_cache` | Purged at `stale_until` (rows with `flagged_at` set stay until an admin clears them); size capped per kind | Nightly delete |
| `places_cache` | Purged one day after `expires_at` (provider cache terms) | Nightly delete |
| `credit_grants`, `credit_ledger` | 7 years (financial records tied to purchases; confirm with counsel), anonymized when the account is deleted | Deletion job sets `user_id = NULL`; delete after 7 years |
| `credit_debts` | With the account; a zero row is deleted after 12 months | Cascade on user delete; nightly delete of `amount = 0` older than 12 months |
| `subscriptions`, `trip_passes`, `store_transactions` | 7 years, anonymized on account deletion. `store_transactions.raw` nulled after 12 months. Import-reward passes follow the same rule | As above |
| `entitlements` | With the account | Cascade |
| `referral_codes` | With the account | Cascade |
| `referral_rewards` | With either account (a deleted account's rows are removed; credits already granted stay in `credit_grants`) | Cascade on user delete |
| `notifications` | 90 days after `created_at` (unread ones too) | Nightly delete |
| `webhook_events` | 12 months | Nightly delete by `received_at` |
| `link_clicks` | 25 months | Partition drop (section 9). `ip_hash` is unlinkable after the monthly salt rotation |
| `affiliate_conversions`, `affiliate_payouts` | 7 years (financial aggregates). `user_id` nulled on account deletion | Deletion job; delete after 7 years |
| `support_tickets` | 24 months after `resolved_at` | Nightly delete |
| `content_reports` | Open reports kept; handled reports 24 months after `handled_at` | Nightly delete |
| `audit_log` | `retention_class = 'standard'`: 13 months. `'extended'` (money, security and control actions, prefixes in 08 4.2): 7 years. The nightly hash-chain digests in R2 are kept 7 years | Nightly delete by class with `SET LOCAL wayfold.audit_purge = 'on'` |
| `data_exports` | The file is deleted at `expires_at` (7 days); the row at 30 days | Nightly job removes the R2 object, then the row |
| `deletion_requests` | 12 months after completion (so a restored backup can be re-purged) | Nightly delete |
| `rate_limit_counters` | 1 day | Nightly `DELETE WHERE window_start < now() - interval '1 day'` |
| `idempotency_keys` | 24 hours (`expires_at`) | Hourly `DELETE WHERE expires_at < now()` |
| `airports`, `fx_rates`, `plans`, `store_products`, `credit_action_prices`, `feature_flags`, `kill_switches`, `affiliate_programs`, `affiliate_link_templates` | Reference data, kept | None |
| Application logs | 30 days | Log platform setting |

### 8.1 Account deletion job

An idempotent worker task with the per-step checklist in `deletion_requests.checklist`, so partial failures are visible and safe to re-run:

1. On request: set `users.status = 'pending_deletion'`, revoke `devices` and sessions, revoke the Apple token (`auth_identities.provider_refresh_token_enc`), cancel pending `trip_invites`, insert the `deletion_requests` row.
2. Owned trips with other members: prompt to transfer or delete; if nobody is chosen, transfer is offered for 30 days and the trip is then deleted. Owned trips with no other members: deleted. Trips owned by others: the user is removed from `trip_members`; their edits stay and show "Former member" (`created_by` is set to null by the foreign keys).
3. After `scheduled_purge_at`: anonymize financial rows (`credit_ledger`, `credit_grants`, `ai_usage`, `subscriptions`, `store_transactions`, `affiliate_conversions`: `user_id = NULL`); scrub log rows by user (`provider_calls`, `link_clicks`, `run_events` do not hold personal data beyond `user_id`, which is nulled in batches per partition); delete personal `people`, then `users` (cascades identities, devices, consents, exports, entitlements, imports, notifications and referral rows).
4. Mark `status = 'completed'`. Deleting an account does not cancel an Apple subscription; the flow links to Settings, Subscriptions without blocking deletion.

## 9. Partitioning

`provider_calls`, `run_events` and `link_clicks` are partitioned by month (`PARTITION BY RANGE`) on their timestamp column, because they grow fastest and are retired by dropping whole partitions instead of running large deletes. All other tables stay unpartitioned at launch; `fare_observations` and `ai_usage` get a review at about 50 million rows (partitioning them later needs a new table and a backfill because their keys are referenced).

Rules for partitioned tables: the primary key includes the partition key (`(id, ts)`, `(id, created_at)`); unique indexes include it too, so lookups by `click_id` or `run_id` always carry a time bound; no table has a foreign key to a partitioned table; log tables hold `user_id` and `trip_id` as plain columns.

```sql
-- Creates the current month, the previous month and p_months_ahead future months, plus a default partition.
CREATE FUNCTION ensure_month_partitions(p_table regclass, p_months_ahead integer DEFAULT 3) RETURNS integer
LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE v_name text; v_month date; v_child text; n integer := 0;
BEGIN
  SELECT relname INTO v_name FROM pg_class WHERE oid = p_table;
  EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS %I PARTITION OF %s DEFAULT', v_name || '_default', p_table);
  FOR i IN -1 .. p_months_ahead LOOP
    v_month := (date_trunc('month', now() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') + make_interval(months => i))::date;
    v_child := v_name || '_' || to_char(v_month, 'YYYY_MM');
    IF to_regclass(v_child) IS NULL THEN
      EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE %I PARTITION OF %s FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
        v_child, p_table,
        v_month::text || ' 00:00:00+00',
        (v_month + interval '1 month')::date::text || ' 00:00:00+00');
      n := n + 1;
    END IF;
  END LOOP;
  RETURN n;
END $$;

-- Drops partitions whose month is older than p_keep_months (by name suffix YYYY_MM, which sorts as text).
CREATE FUNCTION drop_old_partitions(p_table regclass, p_keep_months integer) RETURNS integer
LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE r record; v_cut text; n integer := 0;
BEGIN
  v_cut := to_char((date_trunc('month', now() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') - make_interval(months => p_keep_months))::date, 'YYYY_MM');
  FOR r IN SELECT c.relname FROM pg_inherits i JOIN pg_class c ON c.oid = i.inhrelid WHERE i.inhparent = p_table LOOP
    IF right(r.relname, 7) ~ '^\d{4}_\d{2}$' AND right(r.relname, 7) < v_cut THEN
      EXECUTE format('DROP TABLE %I', r.relname);
      n := n + 1;
    END IF;
  END LOOP;
  RETURN n;
END $$;

SELECT ensure_month_partitions('provider_calls', 3);
SELECT ensure_month_partitions('run_events', 3);
SELECT ensure_month_partitions('link_clicks', 3);
```

| Table | Partition key | Keep | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provider_calls` | `created_at` | 13 months (roll up first) | Daily: `ensure_month_partitions(..., 3)`. Monthly: roll up the month that is about to expire, then `drop_old_partitions('provider_calls', 13)` |
| `run_events` | `ts` | Current plus previous month (30 day product window) | Daily: ensure, then `drop_old_partitions('run_events', 1)` and `DELETE FROM run_events WHERE ts < now() - interval '30 days'` inside the oldest kept partition |
| `link_clicks` | `created_at` | 25 months | Daily: ensure. Monthly: `drop_old_partitions('link_clicks', 25)` |

A missed job is safe: the `_default` partition catches rows, and the next run of a maintenance migration can split it. Alert when a default partition is not empty.

The monthly rollup table `provider_call_rollups` is created with the AI tables (5.6). The job that fills it is:

```postgresql
INSERT INTO provider_call_rollups
SELECT date_trunc('month', created_at)::date, provider, endpoint, count(*),
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE cached), count(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT ok), sum(units), COALESCE(sum(cost_usd_micros), 0)
  FROM provider_calls
 WHERE created_at >= :month_start AND created_at < :month_start + interval '1 month'
 GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ON CONFLICT (month, provider, endpoint) DO UPDATE
  SET calls = EXCLUDED.calls, cached_calls = EXCLUDED.cached_calls, failed_calls = EXCLUDED.failed_calls,
      units = EXCLUDED.units, cost_usd_micros = EXCLUDED.cost_usd_micros;
```
Sizing guide: one month of `provider_calls` is fine without further tuning up to about 1 million rows; summing `cost_usd_micros` over a month partition for one user uses `ix_provider_calls_user_time`. After about 10,000 monthly active users, hot ceiling counters can move to Redis and be reconciled from this table.

## 10. Alembic migration order

The hosted Wayfold database starts empty, so there is no expand-and-contract for the first release: the schema is created in the order below and the owner's data is imported afterwards (section 12). From the first production release on, every migration follows the zero-downtime rules in `../../06-database-and-data-integrations.md` section 3.2 (expand, migrate, contract; `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` inside `autocommit_block()`; foreign keys and checks added `NOT VALID` then validated; `lock_timeout = '3s'`; migrations run as a single pre-deploy job guarded by `pg_advisory_lock`, never at server start).

Practical rules for the revisions: functions, triggers, partitions, policies and views are written as raw SQL in `op.execute()` (Alembic does not autogenerate them); enums use `postgresql.ENUM(..., create_type=False)` after an explicit `CREATE TYPE`; the `NAMING_CONVENTION` from `backend/tripplanner/models/base.py` stays unchanged so autogenerated diffs for plain tables stay quiet; each revision calls `add_updated_at_trigger` and `add_version_trigger` for its own tables. The revisions follow the order of the sections in 5, so every foreign key target exists first and no `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT` is needed to close a cycle.

Any table added after this revision must include its own `GRANT`, `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and policies in the same migration; the test in 6.5 fails otherwise | all tables exist |
| `0015_seed` | Seed data (section 11), idempotent `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` | 0014 |

Airports and FX are loaded by jobs, not by a migration: `wayfold seed-airports` reads the OurAirports CSV and `wayfold refresh-fx` pulls Frankfurter. CI runs the full chain on an empty database, runs the tenant-isolation tests as `wayfold_api_login`, then runs `alembic downgrade base` and `upgrade head` once to prove the chain is reversible in a scratch database (production never downgrades).

## 11. Seed data

Seeds live in migration `0015_seed` and are safe to re-run. Numbers come from the build README and from `../../02-pricing-tiers.md`. Changing a price, limit or credit cost later is an `UPDATE` in the admin console (audited), not a migration. The seed blocks use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so the top-to-bottom run also works against a database that already has rows.

### 11.1 Plans (tiers, passes, credit packs)

Phase 1 seeds six rows: `free`, `plus`, `trip_pass` and the three credit packs. `family`, `pro`, `group_trip_pass` and `advisor_seat` are not seeded, not even inactive (see 1.1); Phase 2 and 3 insert them. Limit keys (all numbers or booleans; `live_routes` is account-wide for tiers and per trip for passes):

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `active_trips` | Active trips an owner may have (fair-use ceiling where the tier is "unlimited") |
| `active_trips_bonus` | Passes only: each trip with an active pass does not count toward the owner's `active_trips` (the "raises the limit by 1" rule; query in 7.5) |
| `routes_per_trip`, `live_routes`, `live_window_days`, `live_checks_max` | Flight routes per trip, live-tracked routes, days before departure that live checks run, live checks a pass allows in total |
| `price_alerts`, `live_alerts` | Alert routes, and whether alerts may use live fares |
| `collaborators`, `travelers_per_trip`, `can_invite` | Collaborators who can be invited to a trip (Free 1, Plus and Trip Pass 6), traveler profiles per trip, whether the owner may invite |
| `saved_lodging_per_trip`, `lodging_compare`, `places_searches_per_day` | Shortlist and search caps |
| `hide_presentation_footer` | True removes the "Made with Wayfold" footer and PDF watermark (Free false, everything paid true) |
| `monthly_ceiling_micros`, `daily_ceiling_micros` | Per-account provider-spend ceilings in micro-dollars |
| `taster_agent_runs` | One-time free deep agent runs |
| `verify_items_per_run` | Most items one "Verify this plan" check may include (Free 5, Plus and Trip Pass 12); more items need another run |

```sql
INSERT INTO plans (code, kind, name, rank, monthly_credits, credits_granted, credits_valid_days, duration_days, feature_flag_key, is_active, sort_order, limits) VALUES
('free', 'tier', 'Free', 0, 12, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, true, 0,

   "collaborators":1,"travelers_per_trip":2,"can_invite":true,"saved_lodging_per_trip":8,"lodging_compare":2,
   "places_searches_per_day":30,"hide_presentation_footer":false,"taster_agent_runs":1,"verify_items_per_run":5,

('trip_pass', 'pass', 'Trip Pass', 25, 0, 40, 90, 90, NULL, true, 40,
 '{"active_trips_bonus":1,"routes_per_trip":3,"live_routes":2,"live_window_days":120,"live_checks_max":60,"price_alerts":2,"live_alerts":true,
   "collaborators":6,"travelers_per_trip":8,"can_invite":true,"saved_lodging_per_trip":30,"lodging_compare":4,
   "places_searches_per_day":100,"hide_presentation_footer":true,"verify_items_per_run":12,
   "monthly_ceiling_micros":1800000,"daily_ceiling_micros":400000}'),
('credits_50',  'credit_pack', '50 credits',  0, 0,  50, 365, NULL, NULL, true, 60, '{}'),

('credits_400', 'credit_pack', '400 credits', 0, 0, 400, 365, NULL, NULL, true, 62, '{}')
ON CONFLICT (code) DO NOTHING;
```

The Free row invites 1 collaborator per trip (`collaborators = 1`, `can_invite = true`) so a couple can plan on the free tier, as the build README and the Phase 1 scope say; the full schema's Free row had 0 and is superseded. Plus and the Trip Pass allow up to 6. Collaborators are counted as every `trip_members` row except the owner, and members beyond the limit after a lapse are treated as viewers by the API (7.1). The traveler and saved-lodging counts follow `../../02-pricing-tiers.md`; align them with the entitlement matrix in `01-product-spec.md` if that file differs (the matrix wins, and this seed is updated in the same change).

Keys that only some rows have (`live_checks_max` on the pass, and the tier-only keys `active_trips` and `taster_agent_runs` that the pass leaves out) are absent on purpose: a missing key means "not granted", and the merge in 7.1 takes the best value among the rows that have it. The referral and import-reward credit amounts are not plan limits; they live in `feature_flags` settings (11.5).

### 11.2 Store products

```sql
INSERT INTO store_products (product_id, store, plan_code, period, price_minor, currency, trial_days, is_active) VALUES
('wayfold_plus_monthly',   'apple',  'plus',            'month',  599, 'USD', 0, true),
('wayfold_plus_annual',    'apple',  'plus',            'year',  3999, 'USD', 7, true),     -- 7-day trial on annual only
('wayfold_trip_pass',      'apple',  'trip_pass',       'once',   999, 'USD', 0, true),     -- non-renewing subscription, 90 days
('wayfold_credits_50',     'apple',  'credits_50',      'once',   299, 'USD', 0, true),     -- consumable
('wayfold_credits_150',    'apple',  'credits_150',     'once',   699, 'USD', 0, true),
('wayfold_credits_400',    'apple',  'credits_400',     'once',  1499, 'USD', 0, true)
ON CONFLICT (product_id) DO NOTHING;
```

Apple product ids are the ids created in App Store Connect; the subscription group is `wayfold_membership` (Plus now; Family and Pro join it in Phase 2). Apple Family Sharing is off. The import-reward Trip Pass has no store product: it is created by `grant_import_reward()`.

### 11.3 Credit prices

1 credit is a budget of up to $0.02, so `hard_stop_micros` equals `credits * 20000` at the uncached price (for `verify_plan`, per checked item).

```sql
INSERT INTO credit_action_prices (action, credits, credits_cached, hard_stop_micros, max_turns, max_searches, max_fetches, model) VALUES
('explain',     1, NULL,   10000, 1,    0,  0,  'claude-haiku-4-5'),
('live_search', 1, NULL,   20000, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
('draft_day',   1, NULL,   30000, 1,    0,  0,  'claude-sonnet-5-5'),
('draft_trip',  4, NULL,  100000, 1,    0,  0,  'claude-sonnet-5-5'),
('research',    8, 1,     160000, NULL, 5,  8,  'claude-sonnet-5-5'),
('agent_run',  40, 8,     800000, 20,   10, 10, 'claude-sonnet-5-5'),
-- verify_plan is priced per checked item: the credits and the caps below are for ONE item (1 credit, one search, one page). A run reserves
-- credits x items (at most verify_items_per_run, 11.1) and its hard stop is hard_stop_micros x items. Reading the pasted plan is a separate
-- 'explain' action (run kind verify_extract); a one-tap evidence recheck is also 'explain' (run kind recheck).
('verify_plan', 1, NULL,    20000, 1,    1,  1,  'claude-haiku-4-5')
ON CONFLICT (action) DO NOTHING;
```

### 11.4 Affiliate programs

Rates, cookie windows and eligibility are "reported, verify" until read on each network's terms page after sign-up (`../../08-affiliate-revenue.md`). `api_credentials_ref` holds an environment variable name, never a secret. Airbnb is intentionally absent and the check constraint blocks it. Insurance stays `planned` until legal review clears it. The Phase 1 checklist item `esim` links to a partner only once a Travelpayouts eSIM program has been confirmed and added as a row here; until then it is shown unmonetized. The direct programs (Expedia Group and Vrbo, Booking.com direct, Skyscanner, Airalo, GetYourGuide direct, AirHelp) and the Travelpayouts compensation program are Phase 2 rows.

```sql

```

Link templates are created after each network's link format is confirmed (Phase 1 checklist in `../../08-affiliate-revenue.md`). One illustrative row, showing the placeholder shape (inactive; verify the parameters in the network's link tool before enabling):

```sql
INSERT INTO affiliate_link_templates (program_id, kind, surface, variant, template, required_placeholders, active)
SELECT id, 'search', 'chosen_flight', 'default',

       '{origin,destination,depart,marker,sub_id}', false
  FROM affiliate_programs WHERE code = 'travelpayouts_aviasales'
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

### 11.5 Feature flags and kill switches

Only Phase 1 flags are seeded. The four new settings at the end of the flags block drive the Phase 1 additions: `setting_import_reward` (the free Trip Pass for a first qualifying import), `setting_referral_credits` (credits for referrer and referee, the expiry, the qualifying rule and the referrer's caps), `setting_booked_fare_drop` (when a booked-fare drop is worth an alert) and `setting_calendar_polling` (feed polling interval and limits). Their numbers are starting values the owner can change in the admin console with a reason and history; they are not from the pricing model.

Per-account holds (`user:<users.id>`) are created on demand by the admin console and expire like any admin-set switch. Every seeded switch starts off (`engaged = false`).

### 11.6 Seed jobs outside migrations

- `airports`: loaded from the OurAirports CSV (scheduled service only), about 4,000 rows.
- `fx_rates`: first pull from Frankfurter at deploy, then twice a day.
- The first `admin_users` row is created with a one-off CLI command (`wayfold admin-grant --email ...`), never through a migration, so no email address lives in the repo.
- Credit grants that are not migrations: the Free allowance and the taster are written on demand by `ensure_free_monthly_grant` and `ensure_taster_grant` (5.8). Only the limit `taster_agent_runs = 1` on `free` and the `agent_run` price are seeded. Import-reward and referral credits are written by `grant_import_reward()` and `grant_referral_reward()` (5.9).
- `sample_trips`: staff create the sample trips and publish them in the admin console; nothing is seeded.
- `places_cache`, `shared_research_cache` and `fare_observations` start empty.

## 12. Mapping the existing Trip Planner data

The owner's current data (the two-person household in the existing app) moves into the new database once, before public launch. The existing model is in `backend/tripplanner/models/` (7 Alembic revisions). Wayfold is a new database, so the import is a script (`wayfold import-legacy`), not an Alembic revision, and it is idempotent: every inserted row is recorded in a mapping table and skipped on a re-run. The example statements in this section use the `legacy` schema and `:parameters`, so they are fenced as `postgresql`.

### 12.1 Table mapping

| Existing table | New table or treatment |
|---|---|
| `people` | `people`. Each of the two people becomes a person owned by and linked to their own new user (`is_self = true`). Any extra guest persons are owned by the primary user with no link |
| `trips` | `trips`. Integer id to UUIDv7 (same creation timestamp). `owner_user_id` = the primary user; the partner becomes an `editor` in `trip_members`. `notes` and `home_currency` copy across |
| `trip_travelers` | `trip_people` |
| `trip_destinations` | `trip_destinations`. `image_file` (a local path) is dropped; `image_url` is kept and hero images are re-fetched into R2 by a follow-up job. `wikidata_id` starts null |
| `flight_routes` | `flight_routes`. Airport arrays cast to `iata_code[]`; `alert_price` (numeric) becomes `alert_price_minor` plus `alert_currency` = the trip's home currency; `is_live = true` when `sources` includes `serpapi`; `chosen_quote_id` becomes a `chosen_flights` row (`paid_minor`, `paid_currency` and `booked_by` stay null: the old app never recorded what was paid, so the booked-fare drop alert starts when the user enters it) |
| `flight_quotes` | Split in two: a shared `fare_observations` row (deduplicated on `search_key`, `source`, `observed_at`, where `search_key` is the SHA-256 of the old `dedupe_key`) and a `trip_fare_links` row carrying `hidden` and `suspect`. `price_home`, `home_currency`, `passengers` and `raw` are dropped (converted at read time; raw payloads are a terms risk). `booking_url` becomes `deep_link_template`. Agent quotes without a `source_url` are skipped and listed in the import report |
| `route_price_insights` | Not migrated (per-route rows; the new table is keyed by market and refills from the next live check) |
| `fx_rates`, `airports` | Not migrated; re-seeded (11.6). `fx_rates` keeps its shape |
| `itinerary_days` | `itinerary_days` (same composite key with a UUID trip id); `destination_id` through the destination map |
| `activities` | `itinerary_items`. Same columns; `version` copies across; `sort_order` starts at 0; money is not present in the old table |
| `places_cache` | Not migrated (regenerable, seven-day TTLs). New rows go to `places_cache`; rental search results to `shared_research_cache` with `kind = 'rentals'` |
| `lodging_options` | `lodging_options`. Prices to minor units; `added_via`: `serpapi` becomes `partner_search`, others unchanged; `raw` dropped; `program_id` null |
| `lodging_votes` | `lodging_votes`, with `user_id` from the person's linked user |
| `routines` | Not imported in Phase 1: scheduled routines arrive with Pro in Phase 2 and the Phase 1 schema has no `routines` table. The legacy rows stay in the `legacy` schema until then. The owner accounts get a comped Plus entitlement (12.2) |
| `runs` | `runs`, only agent and research runs (legacy kinds that map to `fare_hunt`, `deep_research` and `research_question`; scheduled price checks and scans are dropped), with `trigger = 'manual'`. `user_id` = the primary user; `cost_usd_est` times 1,000,000 becomes `cost_usd_micros`; `pid`, `exit_code`, `argv_redacted`, `log_path` are dropped (they belong to the Claude Code CLI runner, which does not carry over); `prompt` is not imported; `report` is kept |
| `run_events` | `run_events`, last 30 days only (partitions for those months are created first). Older events are dropped |
| `agent_notes` | `notes` with `kind = 'agent'` when the note has at least one URL. Notes without a URL become `kind = 'user'` with the title prefixed "From an agent (no source): ", because an agent note must carry a source |
| `ingest_rejections` | `run_events` with `type = 'rejection'` (last 30 days only) |
| `api_calls` | `provider_calls`, last 13 months. `units` int to numeric, `user_id` = the primary user, `cost_usd_micros` null (not recorded before) |
| `app_settings` | Per-user keys (home currency, default airports) into `users.prefs`, `users.home_currency` and `users.home_airports`. Server-wide keys (the SerpApi cap, account sync) become environment configuration or `feature_flags` and are not copied |
| `worker_heartbeat` | Dropped (an ops metric, not user data) |
| Local files (backups, hero images) | Dropped or re-fetched; nothing on disk is migrated |

### 12.2 Import procedure

```bash
# 1. Restore the old dump into a scratch database, then move it into a schema of the target database.
pg_restore --no-owner -d tripplanner_legacy_scratch tripplanner.dump
psql tripplanner_legacy_scratch -c 'ALTER SCHEMA public RENAME TO legacy'
pg_dump --schema=legacy tripplanner_legacy_scratch | psql "$WAYFOLD_DATABASE_URL"

# 2. Run the import as the worker role (it bypasses RLS and writes across tenants).
uv run wayfold import-legacy --primary-email "$PRIMARY_EMAIL" --partner-email "$PARTNER_EMAIL" --dry-run
uv run wayfold import-legacy --primary-email "$PRIMARY_EMAIL" --partner-email "$PARTNER_EMAIL"
```

The two users are created as `users` rows with `status = 'active'` and the given emails; no `auth_identities` row exists yet. On first sign-in (email code, Apple or Google) the verified email matches the pre-created row and the identity is attached (the claim step described in `../../04-users-and-accounts.md`). Nothing about the legacy passcode carries over.

Core statements (the script wraps them in one transaction per entity and records progress in `legacy_id_map`):

```postgresql
-- Temporary mapping table, dropped after the soak period.
CREATE TABLE legacy.legacy_id_map (
  entity     text NOT NULL,
  legacy_id  bigint NOT NULL,
  new_id     uuid NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (entity, legacy_id)
);

-- New ids keep the original creation time (PostgreSQL 18: uuidv7(shift) offsets the embedded timestamp).
INSERT INTO legacy.legacy_id_map (entity, legacy_id, new_id)
SELECT 'trip', t.id, uuidv7(t.created_at - now()) FROM legacy.trips t
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
INSERT INTO legacy.legacy_id_map (entity, legacy_id, new_id)
SELECT 'person', p.id, uuidv7(p.created_at - now()) FROM legacy.people p
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
INSERT INTO legacy.legacy_id_map (entity, legacy_id, new_id)
SELECT 'route', r.id, uuidv7(r.created_at - now()) FROM legacy.flight_routes r
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
-- The same pattern maps destinations, activities and lodging options. Runs already have UUID ids and keep them.

-- Trips (the AFTER INSERT trigger adds the owner to trip_members); the partner joins as editor.
INSERT INTO trips (id, owner_user_id, name, start_date, end_date, status, home_currency, notes, archived_at, created_at, updated_at)
SELECT m.new_id, :primary_user_id, t.name, t.start_date, t.end_date, t.status::trip_status, t.home_currency, t.notes,
       CASE WHEN t.status = 'archived' THEN t.updated_at END, t.created_at, t.updated_at
  FROM legacy.trips t JOIN legacy.legacy_id_map m ON m.entity = 'trip' AND m.legacy_id = t.id
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

INSERT INTO trip_members (trip_id, user_id, role, invited_by)
SELECT id, :partner_user_id, 'editor', :primary_user_id FROM trips WHERE owner_user_id = :primary_user_id
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

-- Flight quotes become shared observations plus a per-trip link. Money converts with the currency exponent.
INSERT INTO fare_observations (search_key, origin, destination, depart_date, return_date, cabin, adults, children, stops_max,
    source, confidence, currency, price_total_minor, airlines, stops_out, stops_back, duration_out_min, duration_back_min,
    depart_at_local, flight_numbers, deep_link_template, source_url, source_domain, observed_at, expires_at)
SELECT encode(sha256(convert_to(q.dedupe_key, 'UTF8')), 'hex'), q.origin, q.destination, q.depart_date, q.return_date,
       r.cabin::cabin_class, r.adults, r.children, r.max_stops,
       q.source, q.confidence::fare_confidence, q.currency,
       round(q.price_total * power(10, currency_exponent(q.currency)))::bigint,
       q.airlines, q.stops_out, q.stops_back, q.duration_out_min, q.duration_back_min,
       q.depart_at_local, q.flight_numbers, q.booking_url, q.source_url, q.source_domain, q.observed_at, q.observed_at
  FROM legacy.flight_quotes q JOIN legacy.flight_routes r ON r.id = q.route_id
 WHERE q.source <> 'agent' OR q.source_url IS NOT NULL
ON CONFLICT (search_key, source, observed_at) DO NOTHING;

INSERT INTO trip_fare_links (trip_id, route_id, observation_id, hidden, suspect, linked_at)
SELECT tm.new_id, rm.new_id, o.id, q.hidden, q.suspect, q.observed_at
  FROM legacy.flight_quotes q
  JOIN legacy.legacy_id_map tm ON tm.entity = 'trip' AND tm.legacy_id = q.trip_id
  JOIN legacy.legacy_id_map rm ON rm.entity = 'route' AND rm.legacy_id = q.route_id
  JOIN fare_observations o ON o.search_key = encode(sha256(convert_to(q.dedupe_key, 'UTF8')), 'hex')
                          AND o.source = q.source AND o.observed_at = q.observed_at
ON CONFLICT (route_id, observation_id) DO NOTHING;

-- Entitlements for the two owner accounts (comped Plus, so they keep the paid limits without a store purchase).
INSERT INTO entitlements (user_id, tier_code, source, valid_until, limits)
SELECT u.id, 'plus', 'comp', NULL, (SELECT limits FROM plans WHERE code = 'plus')
  FROM users u WHERE u.id IN (:primary_user_id, :partner_user_id)
ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET tier_code = 'plus', source = 'comp', limits = EXCLUDED.limits;
```

The remaining entities follow the same pattern (map ids, cast enums, convert `numeric` money with `round(x * power(10, currency_exponent(cur)))::bigint`, set `created_by` to the primary user).

### 12.3 Verification

The script prints a report and exits non-zero if any check fails: row counts per entity (old against new, minus documented skips), no `trip_people` row without a matching `people` row, every trip has exactly one owner member, money totals per currency equal before and after conversion (sum of `lodging_options.price_total` against `price_total_minor`), and an RLS smoke test as `wayfold_api_login` (the primary user sees all trips, a third test user sees none). The legacy schema and `legacy_id_map` are dropped after a 30 day soak.

## 13. Tables added beyond the build README list

The build README list is complete for the product; these tables are added because a rule in the plan cannot be met without them. The first group is carried over from the full schema, the second group is new in Phase 1.

| Table | Why it is needed |
|---|---|
| `plans` | Holds tier, pass and credit-pack limits, credits and ceilings, so the "seed data (tiers)" exists and the entitlement query has something to read |
| `store_products` | Maps each App Store product id to a plan with price, period and trial; one plan (Plus) has several products |
| `credit_action_prices` | Holds the credit price, cached price, hard spend stop and caps for each AI action (build README credit table) |
| `affiliate_payouts` | Named in `../../06-database-and-data-integrations.md` section 6: payouts received per program, for the cash view |
| `route_price_insights` | Existing Trip Planner table (Google price level and typical range) that the fare UI uses; shared by market |
| `activity_log` | The per-trip change feed required by `../../04-users-and-accounts.md` (attribution and "what changed"; the Phase 1 collaboration scope) |
| `rate_limit_counters` | The Postgres-backed rate limits that replace the in-process login limiter (no Redis until about 10k MAU) |
| `provider_call_rollups` | The monthly rollup that `../../06-database-and-data-integrations.md` section 7 keeps after raw `provider_calls` partitions are dropped |
| `idempotency_keys` | The 24 hour replay store for the `Idempotency-Key` header on every money or credit route (04 section 1.6) |
| `credit_debts` | Credits already spent when a pack refund arrives; `credit_grants.remaining` cannot go negative and the API must block paid AI until the debt is repaid (07 5.6) |
| `content_reports` | Reports on shared trips and AI content, required by App Review Guideline 1.2 and by the "three reports pause a cached topic" rule (08 6.12, 06 8.5); the Phase 1 "basic content reports" |
| `trip_imports` | New. The scope table's "Switching" row: import a trip from a calendar file, a calendar feed, pasted confirmations, a Google Maps export or pasted places, with the rival entry used, status, parsed item counts, undo (`import_id` on the items it created), the opt-in feed polling state and the once-per-user free Trip Pass reward, whose flag must survive deleting the trip |
| `plan_verifications`, `plan_verification_items` | New. The "Verify this plan" feature added from the competitive analysis: the items read from a pasted plan, the verdict for each (green, amber, red, unchecked) and the source page and date behind it. Kept 30 days; the pasted text is never stored |
| `referral_codes`, `referral_rewards` | New. "Referral credits" in the Growth basics row: one code per user, one reward row per referred user, idempotent credit grants and an abuse cap |
| `saved_place_votes` | New. "Hearts on stays and places" in the Collaboration row: `lodging_votes` covered stays only |
| `notifications` | New. The Notifications row: push and email for price drops, invites, run results and pre-trip reminders need a de-duplicated outbox, which also serves as the in-app inbox |
| `sample_trips` | New. "Public sample trips" in the Growth basics row: a trip published with a slug and search copy |

New objects that are not tables: the `booked_fare_drops` view and the `chosen_flights` booked-fare columns (the Flights row), the evidence freshness columns (`notes.checked_at`, `itinerary_items.check_url`, `itinerary_items.checked_at`), `users.email_verified_at`, `grant_import_reward()`, `set_import_polling()`, `ensure_referral_code()`, `my_referral_code()`, `redeem_referral()`, `grant_referral_reward()` and `fx_convert_minor()`.

`analytics_events` (optional in the build README) is not created: product analytics stay in PostHog and the metrics the schema must answer (cache hit rate, cost per active user, credit margin, conversion) come from `provider_calls`, `ai_usage`, `credit_ledger` and `affiliate_conversions`. A `legacy_id_map` table exists only inside the `legacy` schema during the import and is not part of the product schema.

## 14. What later phases add

Names only. Each feature pack defines the exact DDL, policies, grants and seed rows for its own additions and ships them as new Alembic revisions after `0015_seed`, using the usual expand-and-contract rules. Adding an enum value uses `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` in its own step; widening a check constraint is a swap of the named constraint. Table names below match the core entity list in the build README; column names are working names that the pack may refine.
