# Pack 04: Printed trip books

Part of [Phase 3: scale](README.md). Tickets P3-045 to P3-057. Written 2026-09-30.

| | |
|---|---|
| Feature flag | `print_orders` (seeded, off) |
| Needs | No hire and no lawyer. An accountant for sales tax on physical goods (Stripe Tax does the calculation). Real vendor quotes before any price is final. |
| Builds on | Phase 1: presentation mode data and PDF export, Stripe webhook endpoint, R2 storage, notifications. Phase 2: memories and sharing cards ([Phase 2](../phase-2-growth/README.md)); the book needs photos, and this pack adds a photo store if Phase 2 did not. |
| Source names | Phase 1 files call this "year 2" and "Phase 4", ticket WF-109. Spec of record: [07 section 11.3](../phase-1-launch/07-monetization-spec.md), [01 section 4.19](../phase-1-launch/01-product-spec.md), [03 section 5.18](../phase-1-launch/03-database-schema.md), [04 section 5.23](../phase-1-launch/04-api-spec.md). |

## 1. Goal and revenue case

**Goal.** A keepsake the traveler orders after a trip: a print-on-demand book (30 pages, hardcover, 8 by 8 inches) built from the itinerary, notes, maps and photos, plus a poster or printed itinerary. Ordered on the web (Stripe Checkout), no inventory, a print vendor ships. It is an optional export from presentation mode, offered once after a trip ends, and it touches no other part of the product (09 section 3.6).

**Unit economics (print costs reported, verify; get quotes from Prodigi, Peecho, Lulu and Printful).**

| Product | Price | Cost | Contribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trip book, 30 pages | $44.99 plus shipping at cost | Print $16 + card $1.60 + returns and support $1.00 | $26.39 |
| Poster or printed itinerary | $24.99 | Print $7 + card $1.03 + support $0.50 | $16.47 (09; the subtraction gives $16.46) |

Reference point: Polarsteps reportedly earns most of its revenue from printed books at EUR 36 to 150 each with 20M users (reported, verify). Gross sales are about 1.7 times contribution ($44.99 / $26.39).

**Margin check.** 07 section 11.3 sets a target of 35 to 45% after vendor cost, shipping and Stripe fees. 09's $26.39 is 59% of the book price because shipping is passed through at cost. The two are compatible only if real shipping is truly at cost. The price guard in P3-049 blocks any quote whose contribution falls below 35% of items plus shipping, and the real vendor quotes (P3-045) decide the final price.

**Revenue (base case, contribution, from 09 section 3.6).**

| Base | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MAU | 20k | 60k | 100k | 150k |
| Attach rate (books and posters per MAU) | 0.4% | 0.6% | 0.8% | 0.8% |
| Contribution at $26 a unit | $2.1k | $9.4k | $20.8k | $31.2k |

Worked: year 5 is 150,000 x 0.8% x $26 = $31,200 (about 1,200 units, roughly $53k of gross sales). Conservative attach is 0.1%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.2%; ambitious 0.6%, 1.0%, 1.2%, 1.2%. 09 adds creator paid guides (0.008 per MAU at $2.29, $2.7k in year 5); they are an acquisition tool and are not part of this pack.

**What would break the case.** The photo and journal feature must exist, real print quotes differ from the inputs, and the attach rate is unmeasured. Test with a manual pre-order (P3-057) before scaling.

## 2. Design decisions

| # | Decision | Default and reason |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Web only | The order flow lives on the web; iOS links to it in the in-app browser with visible chrome. Physical goods used outside the app fall under Guideline 3.1.3(e) (confirm current text). Nothing digital is unlocked. |
| D2 | One product first | Launch with one book (30 pages, hardcover, 8x8) shipping to the US. Posters and printed itineraries follow (P3-056). More sizes, countries and page counts only after the first 100 orders. |
| D3 | Preview before payment | The buyer sees a full page-by-page preview and the exact price (items, shipping, tax) before Checkout. |
| D4 | No partner links in print by default | Partner and affiliate content is left out unless the user adds it; if a partner link is printed, the commission sentence is printed beside it (07 section 11.3, F-PRT). No sponsored content is ever printed. |
| D5 | Vendor behind an interface | `providers/printer.py` with one adapter per vendor, chosen after quotes; the order row stores `printer` and `printer_order_id` so vendors can change. |
| D6 | Liability | Misprints and damage follow vendor policy, refunded or reprinted at no cost to the buyer; the buyer is responsible for content rights. No returns for personalized goods except defects (verify consumer law per country before adding any). |

## 3. User stories and acceptance criteria

**B-1. Offer after the trip.**
As a traveler whose trip has ended, I want to be offered a printed book once, so that I can keep the trip.
- A single card appears in the after-trip wrap-up (F-AFT-2) and in the presentation overflow menu; dismissing it hides it for that trip. No push notification is sent for it (Apple 4.10); one email is sent only to users who opted in to marketing email.
- Available to the owner and editors; viewers do not see it.

**B-2. Build the book.**
As an editor, I want to choose what goes in, so that the book is mine.
- Defaults come from presentation data: cover, title page, one page per destination, stays, one spread per day (map, items, notes marked shareable), a closing page. Empty sections are skipped. Private notes are excluded.
- I can pick a cover photo and title and subtitle, reorder days, remove pages and add photos to days. Page count stays within the product's limits and the price is shown as I edit.
- Photos under the minimum resolution warn with the affected page; photos below the block threshold cannot be placed.

**B-3. Preview and proof.**
As a buyer, I want to see exactly what will be printed, so that there are no surprises.
- A flip-through preview renders every page at proof quality including bleed and safe-area guides toggles. The preview is what the print PDF is built from.
- Text that overflows, blank pages and low-resolution images are flagged before payment.

**B-4. Price, pay, track.**
As a buyer, I want to see the total and follow the order, so that I know when it arrives.
- Quote: items, shipping, tax (Stripe Tax), total, valid 30 minutes (04 section 5.23); address validated; US only at launch (other countries show "Not yet available" with a waitlist).
- Pay through Stripe Checkout (Apple Pay where available). Status: Paid, Preparing, Printing, Shipped (carrier and tracking link), Delivered. Email on paid, shipped and delivered.
- Cancel and refund before the order is submitted to the vendor.

**B-5. Something is wrong.**
As a buyer, I want a simple way to report a damaged or misprinted book, so that it is fixed.
- "Report a problem" on the order (photos allowed) opens a support ticket; support triggers a vendor reprint or a refund from the admin screen.

**B-6. Privacy.**
As a buyer, I want my address removed after delivery, so that it is not kept.
- The shipping address is nulled 90 days after delivery (03 section 8); the PDF is deleted after 12 months.

**B-7. Poster or printed itinerary (later).**
As a traveler, I want a single printed page, so that I can put the trip on the wall or the fridge.
- Choose the map poster or the itinerary page; the same preview, quote and checkout flow; price $24.99.

## 4. Database additions

### 4.1 Already defined in 03 (reuse)

03 section 5.18 defines `print_orders` (revision `0016_services`) with its row policies. If the table exists skip this block.

```sql
@@SQL 2083 2115@@

@@SQL 2696 2699@@
```

Already seeded: flag `print_orders` (off). The print order status machine (`draft`, `awaiting_payment`, `paid`, `submitted`, `printing`, `shipped`, `delivered`, `cancelled`, `refunded`) and retention rules (7 years for financial fields, address nulled 90 days after delivery, unordered drafts deleted after `quote_expires_at`) are as in 03.

Keep photos within limits: 10 MB per upload (existing upload cap), 200 per trip. Originals stay private in R2; thumbnails and proof renders are generated server side. Photos are user content and follow account deletion (03 section 8.1).

## 5. API additions

Base `/v1`, behind the `print_orders` flag. The order routes are already specified in [04 section 5.23](../phase-1-launch/04-api-spec.md) (`POST /print-orders/quote`, `POST /print-orders`, `GET /print-orders`, `GET /print-orders/{id}`, `POST /print-orders/{id}/cancel`); this pack adds the rest.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /print-products` | user | flag | `?country=` to `PrintProduct[]` | Active products for the country with prices and page limits. |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/photos` | editor | flag, 200 per trip | multipart to 201 `Photo` | Type, size and dimension checks, EXIF orientation applied, location data stripped from derivatives. |
| `GET /trips/{trip_id}/photos` | viewer | none | `?limit&cursor` to `Page<Photo>` | Signed, short-lived thumbnail URLs. |
| `PATCH /photos/{id}`, `DELETE /photos/{id}` | editor | none | `{ caption?, alt_text?, itinerary_day_id?, sort_order? }` | |
| `POST /trips/{trip_id}/book-preview` | owner or editor | 10 an hour | `{ sku, layout? }` to 202 `{ preview_id }` | Enqueues a render; layout defaults come from presentation data. Returns flags (low-resolution photos, overflow, blank pages). |
| `GET /book-previews/{preview_id}` | requester | none | to `{ status, pages: { n, image_url, flags }[], page_count, pdf_url? }` | Proof-quality page images; `pdf_url` is a watermarked low-resolution proof. |
| `POST /print-orders/quote` | owner or editor | none | as 04 5.23 plus `sku`, `preview_id` | Adds margin guard: `422 price_below_floor` (internal alert) if contribution is under `min_margin_bps`. `422 shipping_unavailable` outside the country list. |
| `POST /print-orders` | owner or editor | none | `{ quote_id }` with `Idempotency-Key` | As 04 5.23; locks `layout` and renders the print-ready PDF (`pdf_key`) before Checkout is created. |
| `POST /print-orders/{id}/report-problem` | requester | status `shipped` or `delivered` | `{ description, photo_keys? }` to 201 | Creates a support ticket linked to the order. |
| `POST /webhooks/print/{vendor}` | vendor | signature per vendor | status and tracking events | Stored in `webhook_events` (`provider = 'print'`), idempotent, order independent. |

```ts
type PrintProduct = { sku: string; product: "trip_book" | "poster" | "itinerary"; format: string; name: string; size_label: string
  price: Money; min_pages: number | null; max_pages: number | null; default_pages: number | null; ship_countries: string[] }
type Photo = { id: Uuid; trip_id: Uuid; thumb_url: string; width_px: number; height_px: number; caption: string; alt_text: string; itinerary_day_id: Uuid | null; taken_on: string | null }
```

Stripe webhooks ([04 section 6](../phase-1-launch/04-api-spec.md)) already name `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.succeeded`, `charge.refunded` for print orders. Handlers: a paid order moves to `paid`, enqueues `submit_print_order`; a refund moves to `refunded`; all idempotent.

Jobs: `render_book_preview` (render queue), `render_print_pdf` (validates page size with bleed, fonts embedded, image resolution at 300 dpi target), `submit_print_order` (vendor API, retries with backoff, transient and permanent failure classes), `sync_print_status` (poll vendors every 30 minutes as a fallback for missed webhooks), `scrub_print_addresses` and `delete_expired_print_drafts` (nightly, 03 section 8), `purge_print_pdfs` (12 months). Provider calls are logged in `provider_calls`; kill switch `provider.printer`.

## 6. UI screens

Web app under `/trips/{id}/print`; the iOS app shows the entry card and opens the same URL in the in-app browser.

**Entry card.** After-trip wrap-up and presentation overflow menu: "Turn this trip into a book", a cover thumbnail and [Make a book]. Dismiss hides it for the trip. Copy is factual, no urgency: "A 30-page hardcover book from your plan, notes and photos. You see every page before you pay."

**Book builder.** Purpose: choose what goes in. Layout: left page strip (thumbnails, drag to reorder, remove), center page editor (photo slots, caption, title), right panel (cover photo, title, subtitle, page count, price). Photo picker from `trip_photos` with an upload button. Warnings are inline on the page, never modal. States: loading skeleton; no photos "Add a few photos or make the book without them"; render error "We could not build the preview. Try again." with the trip unchanged; offline "Book builder needs a connection".

**Preview.** Flip-through at proof quality, toggle for bleed and safe-area guides, checklist of flags (Low resolution on page 7: Replace or keep), total price visible throughout. [Continue to shipping].

**Shipping and payment.** Address form (US), shipping method at cost, tax line from Stripe Tax, copies (1 to 20), total, and "Pay with Stripe". Fine print: "Printed by {vendor}. Ships in about {estimate}. Personalized items cannot be returned unless damaged or misprinted." Never shown in the iOS app itself.

**Order status.** Timeline (Paid, Preparing, Printing, Shipped, Delivered) with tracking link, total and receipt, [Cancel order] until submitted, [Report a problem] afterwards.

**My orders.** Account page listing orders with status.

Accessibility: every page image has alt text from the page title; the builder is keyboard operable with explicit reorder buttons (drag is an enhancement); money is read with currency; status is text. Events: `print_card_shown`, `print_builder_opened`, `print_preview_viewed`, `print_quote_created {product}`, `print_checkout_started`, `print_order_paid`, `print_order_shipped`, `print_problem_reported`.

## 7. Billing

- **Stripe Checkout** in payment mode, one line per item plus shipping, **Stripe Tax** for sales tax or VAT on physical goods (verify US nexus and registrations; start US only). Apple Pay and Google Pay appear where available. Card fees are modeled at about 3.5% of the order in the contribution figures ($1.60 on $44.99).
- **No In-App Purchase.** Physical goods used outside the app (Guideline 3.1.3(e), confirm current text); the iOS app links to the web page only.
- **Vendor cost.** The print vendor is paid from Wayfold's account (invoice or card on file per vendor). `print_orders.vendor_cost_minor` is recorded from the vendor's invoice to give real margin per order.
- **Refunds.** Full refund before submission (cancel). After shipment, misprints and damage are reprinted or refunded per the vendor policy and support discretion; refunds go through Stripe and set `refund_minor`; the vendor credit is claimed back where available.
- **Accounting.** Revenue is recognized at shipment; sales tax collected is a liability tracked by Stripe Tax reports.

## 8. Admin additions

Extends the console ([08](../phase-1-launch/08-admin-control-center.md); source ticket WF-109 had no admin screen, so this is new).

- **Screen: Print orders (Money group).** List with status, product, buyer (masked), total, vendor status, age, tracking, margin; filter by status, vendor, country, stuck (paid but not submitted over 1 hour, printing over vendor SLA plus 2 days); order detail with timeline from `print_order_events`, preview of the print PDF (download for support), vendor reference and raw vendor status, refund history.
- **Actions.** Retry submission (engineer), cancel and refund (finance up to $100, owner above, typed confirmation), reprint (creates a linked order with `reprint_of_id` at no charge, support or finance), edit the address before submission (support, audited reveal), mark delivered manually (engineer).
- **Products.** A Print products settings tab: activate a sku, set vendor sku, `price_minor`, `extra_page_minor`, `min_margin_bps`. Price changes need the owner (08 section 3 "Settings").
- **Alerts.** Order paid and unsubmitted over 1 hour (page), vendor webhook failures, return and problem rate above 3% of orders in a month (notify), render job failure rate, quote blocked by the margin guard (notify).
- **Finance reports.** Print revenue, vendor cost, contribution and margin per order and per month, tax collected, refund rate.

## 9. Legal and compliance

1. **Sales tax and VAT.** Stripe Tax calculates and reports; counsel or an accountant confirms registration once nexus thresholds are reached. US only at launch avoids VAT.
2. **Consumer rights.** Personalized goods are commonly excluded from return rights; confirm per country before selling outside the US and state the policy before payment. Provide a clear refund route for defects.
3. **Content rights.** The buyer warrants they own or may print the photos and text; terms and a checkbox at order. The vendor's content rules apply (for example nudity and hate content); a vendor rejection refunds the buyer.
4. **Maps.** Printed maps must carry the data licence attribution (OpenStreetMap and the map provider). The Geoapify terms for static maps in print are an open item in the Phase 1 plan and must be confirmed before P3-047 ships; fall back to a self-rendered map from OSM data with attribution.
5. **Privacy.** The shipping address goes to the print vendor as a processor and is scrubbed 90 days after delivery; add the vendor to the processor list and sign its data-processing terms. Children's photos and names are the buyer's responsibility; other travelers' names appear only as in presentation mode, with private notes excluded.
6. **Affiliate and sponsored content.** Not printed by default; if a partner link is printed, the commission sentence is printed with it (FTC, UK and EU rules in [08-affiliate-revenue.md section 7.4](../../08-affiliate-revenue.md)). Partner guide content is never printed.
7. **Apple.** Web-only checkout; the app only opens the page. No claim in the app that a purchase unlocks anything.
8. **Product description.** Accurate size, page count, paper and shipping estimate; no quality claim the vendor cannot support.

## 10. Analytics

Events are in section 6. First-party and admin metrics: offers shown, builder opens, previews viewed, quotes, orders, conversion from offer to order (base case assumes 0.8% of MAU order in year 5), average copies, average price, shipping cost, contribution per order (target at or above $26), problem rate, refund rate, time from paid to shipped, median delivery days, share of orders with photos. PostHog carries the funnel; no ad SDKs. Decision rule after the first 100 orders: if the attach rate is under 0.2% of MAU the lane stays manual and poster work (P3-056) is cancelled.

## 11. Tests

- **Golden PDF.** For a fixture trip the rendered PDF has the exact page count, trim and bleed size, embedded fonts, no pages with overflow, images at or above 300 dpi where the source allows; page thumbnails compare against stored goldens with a small tolerance; private notes and partner links are absent.
- **State machine.** Every legal transition passes and every illegal one raises `409 state_conflict`; events are recorded; cancel refunds before submission and is refused after.
- **Quote.** Expiry after 30 minutes (`quote_expired`), price guard (`price_below_floor`), shipping outside the country list, tax calculation with a Stripe Tax fake.
- **Webhooks.** Stripe and vendor events idempotent and order independent; a missed vendor webhook is recovered by the polling job.
- **Vendor adapter.** Contract tests with recorded vendor fixtures; sandbox order end to end once; retry classes (transient versus permanent rejection).
- **Retention.** Address scrub 90 days after delivery, draft deletion, PDF purge.
- **Privacy and tenancy.** A member of another trip cannot read photos, previews or orders (cross-tenant test includes `trip_photos` and `print_orders`); EXIF location stripped from derivatives; signed URLs expire.
- **Web only.** The iOS client has no purchase UI; the link opens the web page.
