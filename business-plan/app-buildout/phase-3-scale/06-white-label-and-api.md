# Pack 06: White-label and API

Part of [Phase 3: scale](README.md). Tickets P3-071 to P3-081. Written 2026-09-30.

| | |
|---|---|
| Feature flags | `white_label` and `partner_api` (new, off). Both need `advisor_workspaces` on. |
| Needs | A lawyer (master agreement, data-processing addendum, child-data rules before any school operator). An onboarding and support person: support per account is the real cost. A contractor engineer is sensible for custom domains. No funding. |
| Builds on | **Pack 02 must be stable first** ([02-wayfold-for-advisors.md](02-wayfold-for-advisors.md)): this is the same code packaged for accounts rather than seats (09 section 3.7). Phase 1: presentation mode, share links, Resend, Cloudflare, Stripe webhook endpoint. |
| Source names | Phase 1 files call this "year 3 and later". Spec of record: [07 section 11.5](../phase-1-launch/07-monetization-spec.md), which specifies only a direction ("a separate tenancy, API keys, annual contracts invoiced by Stripe"). This pack is the detailed contract. |

## 1. Goal and revenue case

**Goal.** License the planner, presentation mode and group workspace to agencies and tour operators with their branding and their domain, and give them an API for the parts they want inside their own systems. A white-label account is a Wayfold for Advisors organization with an account-level contract instead of per-seat billing.

**Price.** $500 a month per account ($6,000 a year); the ambitious case uses the same price (09 section 3.7). Assumptions to set in the contract template (P3-071): up to 10 staff seats included, extra seats at the advisor seat price ($29 a month), one custom domain, API included with rate limits. A paid API is the same packaging and adds nothing to the revenue totals.

**Revenue.**

| Accounts | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Base | 0 | 1 | 3 | 6 |
| Ambitious | 1 | 4 | 10 | 20 |
| Base revenue at $6,000 | 0 | $6k | $18k | $36k |
| Ambitious revenue | $6k | $24k | $60k | $120k |

Worked: base year 5 is 6 x $6,000 = $36.0k. One account equals about 19 advisor seats ($6,000 / $314.28 net per seat). 09 groups this line with partner guides as "Partner guides and white-label" ($72.0k base year 5).

**Costs and effort.** Medium build (multi-brand theming, custom domain, data-processing agreement, onboarding). Per-account support is the real cost: budget a few hours a week for each new account in its first 90 days (assumption). Do not start before the advisor product is stable.

**What would break the case.** Few buyers (base case needs 6 accounts in year 5), long sales cycles, custom feature requests that turn a license into a consulting business, and a multi-tenant security incident.

**Entry gate (assumptions to tune).** Wayfold for Advisors live at least 6 months with at least 40 paid seats and no severity-1 tenancy incident, and at least 3 qualified inbound requests with a stated budget of $6,000 a year or more.

## 2. Design decisions

| # | Decision | Default and reason |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Same tenancy as advisors | A white-label account is an `advisor_orgs` row with `kind = 'white_label'`. Same RLS, seats, clients, proposals and commission tracker; different billing (account contract) and brand reach. No second data model. |
| D2 | Version 1 scope of branding | Branded client-facing surfaces on the customer's domain: share pages, presentation, proposals, client portal by emailed link, and branded emails. Staff sign in at Wayfold's advisor domain as in pack 02. Full sign-in on the customer's domain (auth redirect allow-lists, cookie scope) is deferred until a signed customer needs it, because it multiplies identity risk. |
| D3 | Disclosure cannot be branded away | Required disclosures stay: partner-link commission sentence, AI-source labels, privacy and terms links. The "Made with Wayfold" footer can be removed. |
| D4 | Partner links default off | On white-label surfaces affiliate links are off unless the contract turns them on; if on, commissions follow the contract and the disclosure sentence stays. Decide the default in P3-071. |
| D5 | API acts as an org principal | Each API key belongs to one org and acts as an org admin seat (`acts_as_user_id`) with scopes; it inherits the same row-level security as that seat. A key is revoked when its admin seat ends. |
| D6 | No school operators until cleared | Child data (COPPA, FERPA) is a gate (P3-080); no account type for schools before counsel signs off. |
| D7 | Minimal service levels | Target 99.5% monthly availability stated as a goal, no credits, response times by plan in the contract (09 section 3.7: service-level promises kept minimal). |

## 3. User stories and acceptance criteria

**W-1. Operator onboarding.**
As an agency owner, I want my brand and domain set up with help, so that clients see my product.
- After contract signature an owner creates the org (kind `white_label`), uploads logo and favicon, picks colors (AA contrast enforced), picks a font from the allow-list, sets contact line, legal links, email sender name and reply-to.
- A preview page shows a sample trip, proposal and share page in the brand before anything is public.

**W-2. Custom domain.**
As an agency owner, I want `trips.myagency.com` to show my client pages, so that Wayfold is invisible.
- I enter the hostname; the app shows the exact DNS records to add (CNAME and a verification TXT); status moves pending, verifying, active; TLS is issued automatically; failures show the reason and the fix.
- Only that org's public pages are served on the hostname; staff screens are not. The hostname can be removed at any time and stops serving at once.

**W-3. Branded client experience.**
As a client of the agency, I want a clean branded page, so that I trust it.
- Share pages, presentation mode, proposals and the client portal render with the org's logo, colors, fonts and contact line, on the org's domain, without Wayfold branding except required disclosures and legal links.
- Emails (invites, proposal sent, reminders) come from the agency's sender name and a verified sending domain when configured, else from Wayfold with the agency name.

**W-4. API keys.**
As a developer at the agency, I want keys with limited scopes, so that my system can read and write trips safely.
- Org admins create named keys with scopes and an optional expiry; the secret is shown once; only a hash and a short prefix are stored; keys can be rotated and revoked; last-used time is visible.

**W-5. Use the API.**
As a developer, I want a documented REST API for clients, trips, items, share links and proposals, so that I can integrate.
- Bearer auth with the key; JSON; pagination, idempotency keys and problem+json errors as in the consumer API; rate limit headers; an OpenAPI document and example requests.
- Writes respect the same validation, limits and audit as the app; a key can never read another org's data.

**W-6. Account billing.**
As an agency owner, I want an annual invoice, so that procurement is simple.
- Contract terms recorded (fee, term, seats included, domains, API limits); Stripe invoice or subscription; renewal notice 60 days before the end; payment by card or bank transfer; usage against included seats and keys visible.

**W-7. Offboarding.**
As an agency owner, I want my data back if I leave, so that I am not locked in.
- Org export at any time (clients, trips, proposals, bookings) in JSON and CSV; on termination the account goes read-only for 30 days, then the custom domain stops and data is deleted on request after export (retention per 03 section 8).

The API key format is `wf_live_<prefix>_<secret>` (prefix 8 characters, secret 32 random bytes, URL-safe). Lookup is by prefix, then constant-time compare of the hash; the key is never logged (logs carry only the prefix). Client-facing data served on a custom domain comes only from the existing share, proposal and presentation reads plus the `brand` and the contract's `partner_links` flag. Retention: `api_usage_daily` 25 months; `org_domains` with the org; contracts 7 years.

## 5. API additions

Two surfaces, both behind their flags and kill switches.

**Org administration (web app, Supabase session).** Base `/v1`, org admin required.

| Endpoint | Auth | Gate and cost | Request and response | Errors and side effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PATCH /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/brand` | org admin | `white_label` | `BrandIn` to `AdvisorOrg` | Validates contrast (AA), font allow-list, logo and favicon type and size; preview token returned. |
| `GET/POST /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/domains` | org admin | `white_label`, domains within the contract | `{ hostname, purpose }` to `OrgDomain` | Creates the Cloudflare custom hostname or the Resend domain, returns `dns_records`. `409` if the hostname is used by another org; `422` for blocked names (see section 9). |
| `POST /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/domains/{id}/check` | org admin | 10 an hour | to `OrgDomain` | Re-checks DNS and certificate state. |
| `DELETE /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/domains/{id}` | org admin | none | 204 | Stops serving immediately and deletes the Cloudflare hostname. |
| `GET/POST /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/api-keys` | org admin | `partner_api`, at most 10 active keys | `{ name, scopes, expires_at?, rate_limit_per_min? }` to `ApiKey` with `secret` once | |
| `DELETE /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/api-keys/{id}` | org admin | none | 204 | Revokes at once; cache invalidated. |
| `GET /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/api-usage` | org admin | none | `?days=` to `{ day, requests, errors, rate_limited }[]` | |
| `GET /advisor-orgs/{org_id}/contract` | org admin | none | to `{ plan, fee, seats_included, domains_included, ends_on, auto_renew, status }` | Read only; changes go through the admin console. |

**Partner API.** Base `/v1/partner`, `Authorization: Bearer wf_live_...`, JSON, problem+json errors, `Idempotency-Key` on writes, cursor pagination, headers `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `Retry-After` (same conventions as [04 section 1](../phase-1-launch/04-api-spec.md)). The key acts as its admin seat (D5), so all limits, validation and row-level security apply. Every call writes `audit_log` with the key prefix as actor.

| Endpoint | Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /clients`, `POST /clients`, `GET/PATCH /clients/{id}` | `clients:read`, `clients:write` | `advisor_clients` fields; no private notes are exposed. |
| `GET /trips`, `POST /trips`, `GET/PATCH /trips/{id}` | `trips:read`, `trips:write` | Create a client trip (owner is the acting seat; client invited by email if given). |
| `GET /trips/{id}/items`, `POST /trips/{id}/items`, `PATCH/DELETE /items/{id}` | `trips:read`, `items:write` | Itinerary items with the Phase 1 validation; versioned with `If-Match`. |
| `GET /trips/{id}/presentation` | `trips:read` | The presentation data (JSON) with brand; partner links only when allowed. |
| `POST /trips/{id}/share-links` | `shares:write` | Returns `share_url` on the org's custom domain when active. |
| `GET /proposals`, `GET /proposals/{id}` | `proposals:read` | Status and the client's response. |
| `GET /bookings` | `bookings:read` | Commission tracker lines (read only in version 1). |
| `GET /openapi.json` | none | The published partner API schema (generated from a separate FastAPI sub-application so the consumer API stays private). |

Errors: `401 unauthenticated` (bad or revoked key), `403 insufficient_scope`, `404 not_found`, `429 rate_limited`, `503 feature_disabled` (kill switch). Out of scope for version 1: AI endpoints, credit-spending actions, billing, user accounts. Outbound webhooks (`proposal.responded`, `trip.updated`) are added only when a signed customer needs them (stretch in P3-077).

```ts
type BrandIn = { logo_key?: string; favicon_key?: string; primary: string; secondary: string; font: "system" | "serif" | "humanist" | "geometric"
  contact_line?: string; legal_terms_url?: string; legal_privacy_url?: string; email_from_name?: string; reply_to?: string
  hide_wayfold_footer?: boolean }
type OrgDomain = { id: Uuid; hostname: string; purpose: "web" | "email"; status: "pending" | "verifying" | "active" | "failed" | "removed"
  dns_records: { type: "CNAME" | "TXT" | "MX"; name: string; value: string }[]; ssl_status: string | null; last_error: string | null }
type ApiKey = { id: Uuid; name: string; prefix: string; scopes: string[]; expires_at: string | null; last_used_at: string | null; secret?: string }
```

Request pipeline for a custom hostname: Cloudflare terminates TLS for the hostname and forwards to the public page service; the service resolves `Host` through `org_for_hostname()`, rejects unknown hosts with a generic 404, applies the org theme, and generates every absolute link from the matched host. CORS and CSP allow-lists are built from active `org_domains` only.

## 6. UI screens

**Brand settings (org admin, web).** Logo and favicon upload, two colors with live contrast checks, font choice from four options, contact line, terms and privacy links, email sender name and reply-to, toggles for the Wayfold footer and partner links (the latter locked by the contract), a live preview of a share page, presentation slide and proposal. Empty: a sample trip is used for preview.

**Domains.** List with status chips, an add form, a records table with copy buttons ("Add these two records at your DNS provider"), a "Check now" action and the last error in plain words ("The CNAME points somewhere else. It should point to {target}."). Domain removal has a typed confirmation.

**API keys.** List (name, prefix, scopes, last used, expiry), create sheet with scope checkboxes and expiry, one-time secret display with a copy button and the warning "You will not see this again", revoke with confirmation, usage chart (requests, errors, rate limited), link to the API docs.

**Contract and billing.** Plan, term, seats used of included, domains used of included, renewal date, invoices link, and "Contact us to change your plan".

**Client-facing pages on the custom domain.** The consumer share page, presentation and proposal, re-skinned: org logo in the header, brand colors and fonts from tokens, contact line, required disclosures (partner-link sentence when enabled, AI-source labels), links to the org's legal pages, and no Wayfold footer when hidden. Errors and expired links show a branded, plain-language message. Accessibility: the contrast check is enforced at save, focus states and skip links are kept, and font choices are limited to tested stacks.

**Public API docs.** A static documentation site (generated from the OpenAPI document) with authentication, errors, pagination, idempotency, examples in curl and Python, and the terms of use.

**Admin console.** See section 8.

Design-system note: theming is token driven ([05 section 2](../phase-1-launch/05-ui-ux-spec.md) tokens become CSS variables set per request from `brand`); no per-customer CSS is ever accepted.

## 7. Billing

- **Account contract.** $500 a month or $6,000 a year, recorded in `white_label_contracts`; billed through Stripe Invoicing or a Stripe subscription for the account (monthly card payment or annual invoice by bank transfer or card). Invoices are net 14 or net 30 as the contract says; dunning follows pack 02 (Stripe retries, then read-only after the contract grace period).
- **Included usage.** Up to 10 seats, 1 domain, API at 120 requests a minute per key (assumptions, set per contract). Extra seats are billed at the advisor seat price through pack 02's seat subscription on the same customer.
- **Net revenue.** Card payments net about 97%; bank transfer nets more. 09 counts $6,000 per account.
- **Tax.** Stripe Tax on invoices; business VAT ids captured.
- **Web only.** Never sold or linked in the iOS app (Guideline 3.1.1).
- **Renewal.** Reminder email 60 days before the end; one-click cancel in the contract view (auto-renew rules, [10 section 3.10](../phase-1-launch/10-quality-security-launch.md)).
- **Cost control.** Custom hostnames, email domains and storage have small per-account costs (Cloudflare for SaaS hostname pricing and Resend domains: verify); they are included in the fee.

## 8. Admin additions

New admin screen "White-label accounts" (Money group); extends [08](../phase-1-launch/08-admin-control-center.md) and pack 02's Advisors screens.

- **Account detail:** contract terms, status, seats used, domains and their states, API keys (prefix only) with last used and 30-day usage, brand preview, recent support tickets, export status.
- **Actions.** Create or edit a contract (owner and finance; typed confirmation), suspend the account (owner: pages fall back to a notice), revoke any API key, force a domain re-check, remove a domain (engineer), start an org export (support), rotate a customer's DPA version, set `school_operator` (owner only, after P3-080).
- **Permissions.** `whitelabel.read` for support, engineer, finance and owner; `whitelabel.contract.write` for finance and owner; `whitelabel.suspend` and `whitelabel.domain.remove` for owner and engineer; the route-permission test covers them.
- **Alerts.** Domain stuck verifying over 48 hours, certificate failure, API error rate above 5% for a key for 15 minutes, rate-limit hits above 20% of requests, a hostname resolving to an unknown origin (possible takeover, page), a contract ending in 60 days (renewal task), seats above the included number.
- **Runbook: onboarding a white-label account.** Contract signed, DPA accepted, org created, brand configured and reviewed, email domain verified, web domain verified, test share link opened from outside, API key issued if requested, 30 and 90 day check-ins.
- **Runbook: domain incident.** Kill switch `white_label.domains`, identify the hostname, remove or suspend, check for dangling records, notify the customer.

## 9. Legal and compliance

1. **Master agreement and DPA.** Wayfold is a processor for the operator's client data; the operator is the controller. The contract covers processing instructions, sub-processors (the current list), security measures, breach notice times, deletion and return of data, audit rights limited to reasonable requests, liability caps, and termination. Counsel drafts the templates once (P3-071).
2. **Service levels.** Availability target and support response times stated by plan, no service credits, maintenance windows; nothing promised that Render and Cloudflare do not support (D7).
3. **Acceptable use and branding.** The operator owns its brand; Wayfold may refuse domains that impersonate other organizations; blocked hostnames include anything containing other travel brands or Wayfold lookalikes; impersonation and phishing complaints disable a domain at once (kill switch). Wayfold's name may be removed from client pages but legal notices, disclosures and the privacy and terms links remain.
4. **Disclosure.** Partner-link commission sentence, "Ad" labels where applicable, and AI-source labels are not removable (D3); FTC, UK and EU rules in [08-affiliate-revenue.md section 7.4](../../08-affiliate-revenue.md).
5. **Child data (school operators).** COPPA (under 13) and FERPA (education records) apply to school trips. The design before any school operator: adult accounts only (teachers and parents), no accounts for children, minimal student data (first names and initials, no photos by default), no AI on student data, contract terms for school officials, and parental consent handled by the school. The gate ticket P3-080 must finish with counsel's written approval; until then the contract template prohibits school use.
6. **Data residency and transfers.** Operators outside the US: standard contractual clauses and a statement of where data is processed.
7. **Security.** Multi-tenant isolation is the headline risk: host-header handling, CORS and CSP built from active domains only, no cookies on custom domains, no sign-in on custom domains in version 1, API keys hashed and scoped, rate limits, audit on every API call, external review before the first customer.
8. **API terms.** No resale of access, no scraping of other users' data, no storage of passport or card numbers, acceptable rate use, right to suspend keys.
9. **Apple.** White-label is a web business product; no sale or link in the iOS app.
10. **Customer-specific requests.** A written scope rule: anything outside the contract's features is a paid project or a no, to keep a license from becoming consulting.

## 10. Analytics

Events: `wl_org_created`, `wl_brand_saved`, `wl_domain_added`, `wl_domain_active`, `wl_api_key_created {scope_count}`, `wl_client_page_viewed` (aggregate, by org, no client identity), `wl_proposal_responded`. Metrics: accounts, ARR, time from contract to first live client page (target 14 days), domain onboarding success rate, API requests and errors per key, pages served per account, seats used versus included, support hours per account in the first 90 days, renewals and churn. Base case needs 1 account in year 3 and 6 in year 5; track pipeline (qualified inbound, demos, proposals) as the leading indicator.

## 11. Tests

- **Isolation.** A key for org A never reads or writes org B (all partner routes, including list filters); a client page on org A's hostname never serves org B's share token; unknown and removed hosts return a generic 404; `Host` header tampering and `X-Forwarded-Host` are ignored unless set by Cloudflare; absolute links always use the matched host.
- **Keys.** Constant-time hash compare, scope enforcement (`403 insufficient_scope`), expiry and revoke effective immediately (cache invalidation test), rate limiting per key with headers, secret shown once and never logged.
- **Theming.** Contrast validation rejects failing colors; the font allow-list is enforced; arbitrary CSS is impossible; required disclosures render and cannot be hidden (snapshot tests for share page, presentation and proposal).
- **Domains.** Fake Cloudflare API: pending to active, failure with reason, removal stops serving at once; blocked hostnames rejected; periodic check detects a dangling record.
- **Email.** SPF and DKIM state from the fake Resend API; fallback sender used until verified.
- **Billing and contract.** Seat and domain limits enforced; renewal reminder; past-due behavior.
- **API conformance.** The OpenAPI document matches routes (generated schema test); idempotency replay; versioned writes with `If-Match`; pagination stability.
- **Security.** Dependency and ZAP scans on the public host handler; penetration test of host routing and key handling before the first customer; load test of a custom hostname at the public page targets.
- **E2E.** Create a white-label org, set brand, add a domain (staging test domain), issue an API key, create a trip through the API, share link opens branded on the test domain, proposal accepted, export works.
