# Phase 1 build prompts

These prompts build all of Wayfold Phase 1 in 28 steps. One orchestrating Claude Code session runs
them in order, one pull request each. Start it with the prompt in [KICKOFF.md](KICKOFF.md).

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [KICKOFF.md](KICKOFF.md) | The one prompt you paste to start (and to resume) the build, plus setup |
| [00-orchestrator.md](00-orchestrator.md) | How the orchestrator runs each prompt: models, loop, PRs, merging, stop conditions |
| [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) | Status of every prompt; the build's memory between sessions |
| [HUMAN_TASKS.md](HUMAN_TASKS.md) | Things only you can do (accounts, keys, Mac builds, App Store) |
| [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) | Judgement calls made during the build |

The order follows `../phase-1-launch/09-build-roadmap.md` and every ticket's dependencies were
checked against it: no prompt needs a ticket from a later prompt. All 129 Phase 1 tickets are
covered; WF-122 and WF-129 are on the roadmap's cut list and are built only if there is room.
