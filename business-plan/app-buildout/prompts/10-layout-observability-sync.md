# Prompt 10: Responsive layout, observability and sync indicator

Phase 1 build, step 10 of 28. Follow `app-buildout/prompts/00-orchestrator.md` for how to run this prompt (branch, models, checks, PR, merge, progress).

## Goal

Finish responsive layout with empty and error states, add Sentry and structured logs, the PostHog base, backups and a restore drill, and the sync indicator.

## Tickets, in this order

Each ticket's description, dependencies, acceptance criteria, files and tests are in `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/09-build-roadmap.md`. The acceptance criteria are the definition of done.

| Ticket | Title |
|---|---|
| WF-036 | Responsive layout, empty and error states |
| WF-037 | Sentry and structured logs |
| WF-038 | PostHog analytics base |
| WF-039 | Backups and restore drill |
| WF-125 | "Synced N seconds ago" indicator |

## Read before starting

- `app-buildout/prompts/PROGRESS.md` (what is already built, decisions made)
- `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/05-ui-ux-spec.md` (layout, states)
- `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/10-quality-security-launch.md` (observability)
- `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/02-architecture.md` (4.5 sync indicator)

## Notes

- Analytics never include personal data: follow the event catalogue in 10 section 4.

## Owner-only steps

Add these to `app-buildout/prompts/HUMAN_TASKS.md` (do not block on them; use fakes, fixtures and flags until they are done):

- Create Sentry and PostHog projects and add their keys.

## Done when

- Every ticket above meets its acceptance criteria, with the tests the ticket names.
- `npm run lint` and `npm test` pass locally and in CI (and `npm run gen:api` is committed when routes changed, and the e2e smoke test passes when a user flow changed).
- No secrets, no em dashes in UI copy, no fetching of Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking.com pages.
- `PROGRESS.md` and `HUMAN_TASKS.md` are updated.
- The pull request `Phase 1 / P10: Responsive layout, observability and sync indicator` is merged into `main`.
