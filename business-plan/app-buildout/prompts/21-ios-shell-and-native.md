# Prompt 21: iOS app shell and native features

Phase 1 build, step 21 of 28. Follow `app-buildout/prompts/00-orchestrator.md` for how to run this prompt (branch, models, checks, PR, merge, progress).

## Goal

Wrap the web app with Capacitor (bundled), add native plugins, Sign in with Apple, App Attest, in-app purchases, universal links for invites, APNs push and notification preferences.

## Tickets, in this order

Each ticket's description, dependencies, acceptance criteria, files and tests are in `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/09-build-roadmap.md`. The acceptance criteria are the definition of done.

| Ticket | Title |
|---|---|
| WF-080 | Capacitor shell, signing and CI |
| WF-081 | Native plugins |
| WF-082 | Sign in with Apple native |
| WF-083 | App Attest and device trust |
| WF-084 | Purchases in the app |
| WF-085 | Universal links and invite flow |
| WF-086 | APNs, devices and push |
| WF-087 | Notification preferences UI |

## Read before starting

- `app-buildout/prompts/PROGRESS.md` (what is already built, decisions made)
- `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/02-architecture.md` (4.4 web and iOS differences)
- `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/05-ui-ux-spec.md`
- `app-buildout/context/business-plan/07-local-to-app-store.md`

## Notes

- Code, config, fastlane lanes and CI workflow can be written anywhere; building, signing and running on a device needs macOS or Xcode Cloud. Do everything that does not need a Mac, verify the web build still passes, and record each device step in HUMAN_TASKS.md.

## Owner-only steps

Add these to `app-buildout/prompts/HUMAN_TASKS.md` (do not block on them; use fakes, fixtures and flags until they are done):

- Enroll in the Apple Developer Program, create the app ID, capabilities and certificates.
- On a Mac (or with Xcode Cloud), build the app, run it on a device, and test Sign in with Apple, purchases in the sandbox and push.

## Done when

- Every ticket above meets its acceptance criteria, with the tests the ticket names.
- `npm run lint` and `npm test` pass locally and in CI (and `npm run gen:api` is committed when routes changed, and the e2e smoke test passes when a user flow changed).
- No secrets, no em dashes in UI copy, no fetching of Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking.com pages.
- `PROGRESS.md` and `HUMAN_TASKS.md` are updated.
- The pull request `Phase 1 / P21: iOS app shell and native features` is merged into `main`.
