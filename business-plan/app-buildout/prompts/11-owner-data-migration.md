# Prompt 11: Import the owner's existing Trip Planner data

Phase 1 build, step 11 of 28. Follow `app-buildout/prompts/00-orchestrator.md` for how to run this prompt (branch, models, checks, PR, merge, progress).

## Goal

Build the one-off importer that moves the owner's existing trips from the old Trip Planner database into Wayfold accounts, with a dry run and a report.

## Tickets, in this order

Each ticket's description, dependencies, acceptance criteria, files and tests are in `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/09-build-roadmap.md`. The acceptance criteria are the definition of done.

| Ticket | Title |
|---|---|
| WF-040 | Migrate the owner's existing data |

## Read before starting

- `app-buildout/prompts/PROGRESS.md` (what is already built, decisions made)
- `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/03-database-schema.md` (legacy import mapping)
- `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/02-architecture.md` (14.3)
- `app-buildout/phase-1-launch/09-build-roadmap.md` (WF-040)

## Notes

- Build and test it against a fixture dump. Running it on the real data is the owner's step.

## Owner-only steps

Add these to `app-buildout/prompts/HUMAN_TASKS.md` (do not block on them; use fakes, fixtures and flags until they are done):

- Export the old Trip Planner database and run the importer's dry run, then the real import, on staging.

## Done when

- Every ticket above meets its acceptance criteria, with the tests the ticket names.
- `npm run lint` and `npm test` pass locally and in CI (and `npm run gen:api` is committed when routes changed, and the e2e smoke test passes when a user flow changed).
- No secrets, no em dashes in UI copy, no fetching of Airbnb, Vrbo or Booking.com pages.
- `PROGRESS.md` and `HUMAN_TASKS.md` are updated.
- The pull request `Phase 1 / P11: Import the owner's existing Trip Planner data` is merged into `main`.
